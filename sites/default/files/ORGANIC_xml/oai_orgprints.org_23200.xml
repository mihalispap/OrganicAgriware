  <dc:description>As part of the EU Core Organic II research project ICOPP (Improved contribution of local feed to support 100% organic feed supply to pigs and poultry), a feeding trial was conducted in which grass pea seeds were included in diets for weaned piglets. The grass pea is a hardy grain legume that produces protein-rich seeds, but due to its content of the neurotoxin ODAP, intensive feeding is risky. Since ODAP is water-soluble and susceptible to heat, hydrothermal treatment (=toasting) greatly reduces toxicity. In the feeding trial, four isocaloric diets with a similar lysine content were compared: A control diet, one diet containing 20% raw grass pea seeds, and two diets with toasted grass pea seeds (20 and 30%, respectively; as fed basis). Including grass pea seeds in the diet had no significant influence on feed intake of the piglets. The body weight development of the piglets did not differ between the control diet and the two diets containing toasted grass pea seeds, whereas including raw grass pea seeds had a significantly negative effect: Two weeks after weaning, piglets weighed significantly less than all other groups, and this difference became even more pronounced with time. As a consequence, the feed conversion ratio was significantly higher in the diet with raw grass pea seeds as well. Therefore, toasting of grass pea seeds is recommended prior to feeding to piglets.</dc:description>
