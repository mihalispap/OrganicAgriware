  <dc:description>The pear leaf blister mite can cause severe damages to pear trees. By their hidden way of living inside&#xD;
the leaf blisters, the mites are protected from plant protection agents. Until now, oil treatments&#xD;
in early spring, when the mites leave their hibernation sites and invade the young leaves, are the&#xD;
only possibility to control these mites. Because of the low temperatures during this period (February/&#xD;
March) the efficacy of pesticides is often not reliable. The aim of this study was to assess the effects&#xD;
of sulphur applied after harvest at the time, when mites are leaving the blisters and migrate to&#xD;
the hibernation sites. The treatments were applied shortly after harvest to benefit from the mild temperatures&#xD;
in September. Visual controls in following spring showed convincing results: With an efficacy&#xD;
of 95% (one sulphur application in autumn) or 100% (three sulphur applications in autumn),&#xD;
respectively, even a decontamination of heavily infested orchards is possible.</dc:description>
