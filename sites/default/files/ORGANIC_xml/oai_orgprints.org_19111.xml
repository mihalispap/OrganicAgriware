  <dc:description>This study was conducted with the “Camarosa” strawberry cultivar at the Egirdir Horticultural Research Institute between 2004 and 2006. In these experiments, the impact of some nutrition applications upon plant development in conventional and organic production has been analyzed. The planting has been performed with frigo plants in the third week of July and black plastic mulch was used for mulch system and dripping method was used for watering system in the experiment. When evaluating the data of two years statistically according to plant width, plant stem number, leaf number and root length, the difference in both applications and years has given importance.</dc:description>
