  <dc:title>Food Safety Debate and Development of Standards/Regulations for Organic Farming and Organic Food</dc:title>

  <dc:description>There is an on-going debate, in which way Organic Food production systems do contribute to food safety. Only few comparative studies do exist. However Organic Farming developed a system approach which is mainly focussing on the process of production rather than on the end-product analysis. This approach, which is traditionally outlined in Standards and Regulations for Organic Farming, can bring benefits for food safety issues such as less contamination with chemicals, etc. But not all food safety areas are covered in standards/regulations, mainly because Food Safety is an issue of public health laws, which Organic Farming has to fulfil as well.</dc:description>
