  <dc:description>This report was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Consumer attitudes to foods are mainly influenced by quality attributes.  Ethical factors are important in some cases, but they may be overstated.  The relationships between consumers' awareness of organic food, price  and perceived quality of food were investigated by tests involving series of  consumer panels and sensory evaluation. Sensory responses were also  matched to instrumental analysis data. Results indicated that overall there  was no relation between panellistâ€™s views about organic foods and their  sensory perceptions. Eighty percent of the panellists felt that organic  products were too expensive, but would buy them if they were cheaper.  However the study showed that most of the people would not be likely to  change their preference once they had made a product choice based  upon sensory attributes. This has important implications, indicating that  not only price, but also sensory quality of organic food must be considered  in order to maintain repeated purchases by most consumers.</dc:description>
