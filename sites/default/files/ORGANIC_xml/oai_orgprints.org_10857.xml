  <dc:description>Peter Davies farms 750 acres in the Vale of Glamorgan. He has a suckler herd and sheep, with arable crops for sale off the farm and for livestock feed. The farm began conversion in 1999 and most of it will finish in 2001. It was accepted into the Tir Gofal whole farm agri-environment scheme in 2000. In this interview with Will John he explains how the two schemes work together. He has researched and planned the changes carefully and expects his farm enterprise to benefit in the long term.</dc:description>
