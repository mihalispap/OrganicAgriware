  <dc:description>Organic farming requires that in the choice of breeds or strains, account must be taken of the capacity of animals to adapt to local conditions, their vitality, and their resistance to disease. In addition, breeds or strains of animals shall be selected to avoid specific diseases or health problems associated with some breeds or strains used in intensive production. This review considers the research into organic dairy cow breeds and breeding, it discusses the need for a specific organic approach to breeding and cross breeding and makes some clear recommendations for selection priorities.&#xD;
This research review describes the outputs from a range of studies on dairy cattle breeding that have specific relevance to organic farming conditions.</dc:description>
