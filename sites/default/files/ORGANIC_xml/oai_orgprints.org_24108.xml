  <dc:description>A significant increase in the domestic organic market, especially in Buenos Aires city can be observed in Argentina. Horticultural products represent a large percentage of the total organic volume traded. Within these, increasingly evident interest in heritage type products, niche type or heirloom can be observed. As the development of these products is almost incipient, varieties of tomatoes were rescued to characterize its production profile for possible adoption by organic horticultural producers in the area of Buenos Aires. A greenhouse trial with 14 varieties of tomatoes was developed. They were: PeaceVein, Ildi Red and Yellow, Black Plum, Chadwick, Saint Pierre, Thessaloniki, TSW10,  Platense Gentile, Money maker, Mars, Uco Plata and the hybrid Koyi (from TheRuiterSeeds) and Elpida (Syngenta). Phenological and reproductive characteristics and agronomic profile of each variety were evaluated. The results concluded that some varieties are suitable to be incorporated to the horticultural trade as a complement of organic vegetables in the Horticultural Greenbelt in Buenos Aires. The most important varieties were the Ildis ones, with attractive color and piriformis; Black Plum, an old mahogany ovate tomato variety; Chadwick, also known as very productive variety of tasty fruit. Those who need further research include tomato Platense Gentile and Uco Plata.</dc:description>
