  <dc:description>Organic cotton production currently takes place in 22 countries resulting in 241’697 metric tons of fibre and 1.1% of the global cotton production (Truscott et al. 2010). Up to 80% of world’s organic cotton is produced in India. However, this market is threatened due to the displacement of traditional cotton species and cultivars by genetically modified (GM) hybrids selected for high input farming. Organic cotton farmers are facing increased difficulties in finding suitable cultivars in India (Nemes, 2010). Moreover, there is a big risk of physical and genetic contamination of organic cotton with GM cotton and the loss of locally adapted genetic resources. Therefore fast action is needed to re-establish a GM-free seed chain and breeding programs for cultivars suited for organic and low input farming conditions.</dc:description>
