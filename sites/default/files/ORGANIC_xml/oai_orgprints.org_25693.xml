  <dc:description>Eberswalde University has been establishing an innovation network for organic farming and processing in the Federal State of Brandenburg and the city of Berlin in the north-eastern part of Germany. During the last decade, the network enabled several cross-disciplinary study and research projects. Organic farmers, small and medium-sized organic food processors and trade businesses, research institutes, advisory services as well as governmental and non-governmental organisations contributed to the development of this network. The projects that are jointly implemented focus on strategy development and practical problem solving for organic food value chains.</dc:description>
