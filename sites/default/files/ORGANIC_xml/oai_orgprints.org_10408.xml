  <dc:description>Organic and free range pigs are potentially exposed to a wider range of parasites and zoonotic challenges. The livestock Subproject QLIF addresses 4 strategies to combat these challenges, and the present paper describes the initial results. Rodent control is the first strategy, and a survey concludes that Salmonella and Campylobacter infections were encountered in house mice and Norway rats, but not in other species. T. gondii antibodies could be detected in 6.4% of the blood samples taken from 235 wild small mammals. To reduce the presence of rodents around farms, the use of live-traps may be a good alternative for the use of rodenticides on organic farms. A second strategy is aimed at directing pig dunging behaviour in such a way that contact with (infected) faeces is minimised. The study showed that a rooting area resulted in a cleaner outdoor are and an extra outdoor drinker led to a cleaner area around the drinker, but to a dirtier indoor area. However, no difference in Ascaris suum infection were found. The nutritional strategy tested showed that pure inulin appeared the most effective as Oesophagostomum dentatum presence was reduced by 91%. Finally, as part of Strategy 4, a mixture of dried Thymus vulgaris, Melissa officinalis and Echinacea purpurea in a dosage of 5% in the diet showed to be preventive against a mild round-worm infection. The same mixture, however, was not effective in a lower dosage (3% in the diet) against a serious round-worm infection. Work is continuing to develop the above strategies further.</dc:description>
