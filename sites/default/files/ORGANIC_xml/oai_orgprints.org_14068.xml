  <dc:description>A simulation program for infections by Sooty Blotch was developed based on&#xD;
literature data and expert judgements. The value of the model as tool for timing&#xD;
fungicide sprays to control Sooty Blotch was tested in 2003 in two randomized plot&#xD;
trials, and four “on farm” trials where the treatments where made by the growers.&#xD;
Disease pressure was relative low due to the warm and dry summer of 2003. Two to&#xD;
five post infection treatments with lime sulfur or coconut soap aimed at severe&#xD;
infection periods as indicated by the model provides 72 to 100 % control.</dc:description>
