  <dc:description>This report is part of the research project “Further development of Organic Farming Policy in Europe, with Particular Emphasis on EU Enlargement” conducted with financial support from the Commission of the European Communities. It documents the development of organic farming and its policy and regulatory environment in ten selected CEE states between 1997 and 2003.&#xD;
The countries included in the research are the Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Hungary (HU), Poland (PL), Slovenia (SI), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Slovakia (SK), Bulgaria (BG) and Romania (RO). Countries were divided into two groups: the first group (CZ, EE, HU, PL and SI) was studied in more detail; a simplified questionnaire was used for the second (LV, LT, SK, BG and RO).</dc:description>
