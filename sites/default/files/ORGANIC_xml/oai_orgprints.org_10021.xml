  <dc:description>Tasmania, Australia's island state, appears to have a huge potential for organic agriculture. The state has a higher proportion of rural dwellers than other Australian states, it has a long tradition of successful agricultural pursuits dating from the earliest European settlement, it is the only state with its own own organic certifier, and geographically it is well placed to capitalise on its clean and green image. Statistics reporting organic farms per capita  for Tasmania and Australia are presented and compared with other jurisdictions.</dc:description>
