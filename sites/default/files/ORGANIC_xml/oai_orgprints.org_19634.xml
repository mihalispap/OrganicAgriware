  <dc:description>The paper explores whether an organic control system could include elements of an improvement standard as compared to the current minimum requirement standards. It is based on a review of rules of organic certification and of literature. The discussion explores whether an approach of agreeing individual improvement targets between operator and certification body could allow the consideration of some areas of the organic principles that are currently not audited in the form of minimal certification requirements. Such a system would allow the determination of whereof whether an operator is on the way to making improvements and strengthen operatorsâ€™ responsibility.</dc:description>
