  <dc:title>Natural pesticides for organic farming - desk study</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Crop health, quality, protection</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This desk study will attempt to identify natural pesticides for possible use in organic agriculture.  The study concentrates on chemicals extracted fro plants or closely derived from them which have insecticidal, fungicidal or herbicidal action.  The study has three main sections: (i) substances which are already approved for use in the UK, for example, Pyerthrins and Derris; (ii) substances licensed for use as pesticides eleswhere in the world, for example Neem and Linalool; and (iii) plant materials or substances which have some documented biocidally active potential but which have not been developed commercially, for example Delphinine and Hibiscus.</dc:description>
