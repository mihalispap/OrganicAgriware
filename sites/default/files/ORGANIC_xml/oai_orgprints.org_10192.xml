  <dc:description>Innovation is essential to allow organic vegetable growers to continue to develop in response to a changing market and environment. This paper examines uptake of innovations amongst a group of organic vegetable growers over a period of three years. The study revealed that innovations in a wide range of disciplines were carried out and that both small and large farms were active in pioneering innovations. The drivers behind innovation and the various factors infl uencing uptake and implementation were varied and complex and are discussed here.</dc:description>
