  <dc:description>This chapter explores the Organic farmingâ€™s development potential in Europe by analysing&#xD;
the enterprises capacities to reach a workable structure of the supply chains, in order to&#xD;
market good products at reasonable prices. This study has been carried out in the framework&#xD;
of an European project (OMIaRD), which aimed to assess the impact of the Organic&#xD;
Marketing Initiatives on Rural Development. The results show that, after a growing phase,&#xD;
most of the Organic Marketing Initiatives meet a strategic turn point, linked to their ability to&#xD;
face logistic problems, linked to an increasing of collected, processed and marketed volumes.&#xD;
This strategic turn point leads them to take decisions together with their stakeholders, so as&#xD;
the economic and ethical goals are not questioned by the changes to be implemented.</dc:description>
