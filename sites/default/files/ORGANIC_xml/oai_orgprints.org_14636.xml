  <dc:description>Ovules of seedless grapes (Vitis spp.) fertilized by controlled pollination increased in size during berry development. Hybrid bunches picked at 30,35,40,45,50 and 55 days after pollination. Ovules were dissected and then cultured in media for 60 to 70 days. Developing ovules were placed in germinative medium. After embryos germinated for 10 days. They were transferred in plant medium to promote them formed normal plants. The result indicated that the most appropriatest medium was Nitsch with GA 30.2m VI, IAA 1.5mgll, ZT1.0 mg/l. The suitable sampling period was after pollination 35 to 50 days. The germinate and the plant rate of 'perlette x' Flame seedless' were the highest in the five crosses, which were 70.2% and 24.8%.&#xD;
