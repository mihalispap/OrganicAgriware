  <dc:description>The presentation provides a short overview of organic farmign support in the European Union, where government intervention has been very important for the development of the sector. Initiatives of individual governments in the 80s were followed by European Regulations on organic standards and setting the framework for financial support to organic producers under agri-environment support. Initial focus on conversion support resulted in imbalances in supply and market but also provided impetus for market growth. The focus now more on integrated policies (action plans) integrating pull and push measures. The presentation concludes that governments need to be clear about why organic farming is worth supporting.</dc:description>
