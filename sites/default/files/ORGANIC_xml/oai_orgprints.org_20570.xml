  <dc:description>The Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera Tephritidae), is the key pest in some organically managed citrus orchards in Sicily. The effectiveness of processed kaolin (Surround WP) for control of C. capitata damage was tested in field trials carried out in 2003-2004 on two early ripening citrus species: satsuma (Citrus unshiu Markow.) and clementine (Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan.). Although the number of males captured in trimedlure baited traps was high in both years and in both orchards, the percentage of damaged fruit varied greatly from almost 0% (satsuma 2003) to more than 60% (clementine, both years). Nevertheless, the application of processed kaolin significantly reduced damage caused by C. capitata on both citrus spe- cies on preharvest fruit on some dates and on harvested fruits in both years. The kaolin was easily removed from harvested fruit by washing. Processed kaolin has potential for reducing damage caused by C. capitata in organic and conventional citrus or- chards.</dc:description>
