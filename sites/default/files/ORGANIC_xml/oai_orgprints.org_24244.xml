  <dc:description>Like all other Traditional Crops, Vegetable Diversity has been seriously endangered by modern varieties bred with market objectives, such as easy transportation over long distances, response to chemicals etc.  These modern varieties make the seed and agrochemical companies rich, farmers poor and consumers sick.  This talk cum slide show is on the need to conserve traditional vegetable diversity and shows how this has been and can be achieved at a home scale, providing nutritious vegetables for home use as well as generating an income from seed.</dc:description>
