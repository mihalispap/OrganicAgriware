  <dc:description>The uptake of organic research by commercial producers has been variable due to a number of factors including lack of access to research findings, financial pressures, research priorities, market demands and producer perspectives. Consequently “best organic practice” is not universally applied and apparently intractable problems remain, even though in some cases solutions are available. This paper identifies the role of advisers in supporting organic farmers and the establishment of a system for disseminating the results of research through a number of routes including a web-based archive, advisory leaflets and workshops.</dc:description>
