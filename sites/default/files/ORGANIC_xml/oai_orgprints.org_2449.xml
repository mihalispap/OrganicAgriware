  <dc:description>Manure application increased yield. Hence the study was conducted under the conditions of moderate nutrient stress and in all probability nitrogen stress. &#xD;
Under this condition nutrient uptakes, biomass production and grain yields did vary between Otira, Orthega, Landora, Brazil, Svani, NK96-300, Mixture 1 (Otira, Orthega, Landora) and Mixture 2 (Brazil, Svani and NK96-300). Interaction between variety and soil fertility treatments were also significant. These findings open new possibilities for selection or plant breeding for genotypes with improved capability of nutrient acquisition from soils at different soil fertility levels e.g. in organic farming.&#xD;
Cropping of barley varieties in mixtures seems to increase (stimulate) nutrient uptakes (N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Mn, Zn, Cu and Mo) and biomass production.</dc:description>
