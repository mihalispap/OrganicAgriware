  <dc:description>When it comes to discussions on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and organic agriculture, biotechnologists often ask: “Why are your rules so strict? Why ban GMOs when they are the only tool to secure the world’s future need for food? They are more efficient, quicker, etc!”&#xD;
When asked these questions I explain the underlying values of organic agriculture. In this article I will discuss the basic values of organic agriculture as laid down in the IFOAM four basic principles, and will relate them to the field of plant breeding. I also discuss the consequences and challenges for the further development of organic plant breeding.</dc:description>
