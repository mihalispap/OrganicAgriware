  <dc:description>Interesting growth potential starts developing through the presence of few actors that spearhead most commercial activities in a sector. Such actors are very innovative but do not necessarily have all the necessary know-how. The Leader approach has a strong business development focus with the objective to strengthen such pioneers and spread the experience among small- and medium enterprises in order to enter the sector and contribute to growth.</dc:description>
