  <dc:description>Different stages of Trupanea stellata and Lasioderma serricorne were exposed to four different gas mixtures differing in their CO2 content (20%, 40%, 60% and 80% CO2). In general, increase in carbon dioxide combined with decrease in oxygen resulted in increasing mortality. The gas mixture containing 80% CO2 was the most effective mixture to control the different stages of T. stellata (most tolerant than the different stages of L. serricorne insects). The use of this gas mixture to disinfest chamomile for 7day exposure in 30 m3 fumigation chamber under temperature range between 28.7-30.9oC, resulted in complete control.</dc:description>
