  <dc:description>Organic plant production is characterised by a relatively low level of nutrient supply. Compared to conventional farming this leads to an earlier completion of vegetative growth and an earlier onset of maturity processes. Therefore, in general organic plant products are more mature than conventionally produced plant products. Organic animal production is based on the use of roughage, outdoor production and a lower growth rate compared to conventional farming.  As an effect of these production system differences a number of differences in food quality is predictable and some of these have been documented in the literature.    The review is based on existing literature and ongoing projects comparing nutrients, secondary metabolites and foreign compounds in organically and conventionally produced foods, respectively. Effects of well-known differences between the production systems are also included in the discussion, such as nutrient supply, feeding systems and varieties/breeds used.</dc:description>
