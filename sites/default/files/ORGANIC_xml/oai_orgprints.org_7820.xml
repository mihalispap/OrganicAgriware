  <dc:description>Subsoil compaction is a widespread problem on Danish arable soils and especially in form of plough pan compaction. Subsoil compaction may reduce crop yield and quality, increase negative environmental impact (e.g. in form of increased nitrogen leaching), and reduce soil workability and traffic ability of the soil. Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences has in a DARCOF project investigated the effect of subsoil loosening. The investigations were carried out in an organic crop rotation experiment at two sandy loams: Flakkebjerg (13% clay) and Foulum (8% clay).</dc:description>
