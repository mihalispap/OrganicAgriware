  <dc:description>"Analysis of the European market for organic food" is the first volume to be published by the OMIaRD project. In providing the most comprehensive and up to date information and analysis of European organic food markets, it offers important information in its own right but also contributes a foundation for further study. It covers all important aspects of the organic market, including production, consumption, foreign trade, supply deficits, prices and premiums. Nineteen countries have been separately investigated, and comparison and overview allow important policy and marketing conclusions to emerge.</dc:description>
