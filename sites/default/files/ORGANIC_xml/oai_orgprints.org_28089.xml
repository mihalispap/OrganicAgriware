  <dc:description>The main dietary challenge for poultry producers is ensuring that feed fulfills the nutrient requirements of poultry, in particular with regards to protein and the correct amino acid profile. This is a particular challenge for organic poultry producers as the use of synthetic amino acids is not allowed. There has been a derogation from the EU Organic Regulatory Board to allow organic pig and poultry producers to include up to 5% non-organic feed within their rations to assist in meeting the nutritional requirements of the animals. This derogation was due to finish at the end of December 2014 but has now been extended to 31 December 2017 when it will become compulsory under EU Regulations (EC) no 889/2008 to provide all organic livestock with feed derived from 100% organic origins. This guide analyses the potential of locally produced and novel protein sources as viable, alternative feed sources for the organic poultry industry</dc:description>
