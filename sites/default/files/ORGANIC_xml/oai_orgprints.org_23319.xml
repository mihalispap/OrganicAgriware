  <dc:description>Despite the continuous growth of the organic market in Europe, in most countries only very basic statistics about this sector exist. There are a number of reasons for the need for reliable data on European organic production, retail sales and trade. Above all, data and market information are needed by private and public actors to make correct decisions; by farmers and other members of the organic supply-chain to make investment decisions; and by policy makers to calibrate measures targeted to the organic sector. To understand the availability of data on the organic market, and to assist in improving data quality and availability, it is first necessary to be aware of the organisations that currently collect, analyse, and/or disseminate such data across Europe and the methods that they use. Furthermore, it is necessary to identify the needs and demands of end users of organic market data, and to find areas of information asymmetry. The results of two surveys carried out in Europe: one of data collectors and one of end-users of organic market data are presented. The purpose of these surveys was to produce an overview of collectors of organic market data in Europe and its neighbouring countries and a description of the needs of end users of such data. The results have delivered a good picture of the situation in Europe and have shown that the recent claims, coming from various sources, regarding a lack of organic market data are justified. There was an almost universal expression by end users of feeling at a competitive disadvantage because of lack of available data for all data types. This is problematic, as without good quality, accurate and timely information it is difficult for stakeholders to make decisions about the risks and benefits of investment.</dc:description>
