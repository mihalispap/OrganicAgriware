  <dc:description>In a recent study on rats, complete diets produced from three cultivation systems were compared on a range of health biomarkers, and notable differences appeared with regard to IgG levels(1). In order to chase this result, the objective of the present study was to develop an oral tolerance model in rats for comparison of diets composed of ingredients from different organic and conventional cultivation systems with regard to immunological responses.</dc:description>
