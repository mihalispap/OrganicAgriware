  <dc:description>A preference test was conducted to investigate whether rats could distinguish among three iso-energetic and iso-nitrogeneous human diets prepared with ingredients cultivated by each of three different farming strategies:  LIminusP: low input of feritlizer without pesticides, LIplusP: lowinput of fertilicer and high input of pesticides and LHplusP: high input of fertilizer and high input of pesticides. The experimental diets were formulated to meet the NRC requirements for growing rats by mixing potatoes, carrots, peas, green kales, apples, and rapeseed oil. For five days, rats (N=27) had free access to each of the three diets, and consumption of each of the diets was recorded daily. Thereafter, rats were offered a standard laboratory chow until the test was repeated. The results indicated that the majority of the rats showed individual preference for the diets and behaved similarly on different experimental days (ρ = 0.63 in repetition 1 and ρ = 0.73 in repetition 2) and in the two repetitions (τ = 0.79). However, no clear difference among the dietary treatments could be obtained.</dc:description>
