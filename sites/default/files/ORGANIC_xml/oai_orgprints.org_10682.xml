  <dc:description>The sequential leaves of the shoot show a 'biography' of the growing season. The shape of the leaves shows the conditions under which the leaves are formed. &#xD;
This method was developed to help answer the questions of fruit growers and researchers. Fruit cultivation researchers need to record vegetative development during the course of the growing season. The quality of the shoots with the leaves determines the 'production capacity' of the tree and the quality of the fruit and the buds for the next year.</dc:description>
