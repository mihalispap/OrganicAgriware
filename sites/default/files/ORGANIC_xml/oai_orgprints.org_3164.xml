  <dc:description>Abstract - Field experiments with spring wheat and faba bean were carried out at the Hessian State Estate Frankenhausen located near Kassel  in Central Germany in 2003 - 2005. As part of the EU Project “Intercrop”, spring wheat and faba bean were sown out as sole crops and intercropped with different seed rates, using two sowing techniques and with and without N supply. Intercropping was able to increase yield in the most treatments. All LER’s were higher than 1 and the N content in grain also increased in intercropped variants. The influence of the sowing technique was rather low in comparison to the seed rate.</dc:description>
