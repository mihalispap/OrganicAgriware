  <dc:description>This paper has been prepared as a background document for the meeting of the International&#xD;
Task Force on Harmonization and Equivalency in Organic Agriculture to be held in October 2003. Its purpose is to provide a general overview of the current situation with respect to regulations, standards and conformity assessment systems for organic agriculture and&#xD;
processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
The subject matter of several sections of this document was previously addressed in the&#xD;
Reader for the February 2002 Conference on International Harmonization and Equivalence in&#xD;
Organic Agriculture published by IFOAM. In compiling this overview the author has drawn&#xD;
heavily on the previous texts updating the data as appropriate. In many ways what follows is a synopsis of the documents in the IFOAM publication. The reader seeking a more in-depth treatment of these subjects is directed towards the Reader.</dc:description>
