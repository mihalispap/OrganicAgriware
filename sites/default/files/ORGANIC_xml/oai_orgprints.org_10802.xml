  <dc:description>The CAP Reform agreement reached in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003 has significant implications for all producers. This factsheet focuses on those aspects of the reform package of specific interest to organic producers in Wales, and should be read in parallel to Factsheet 16 which gives definitions and provides more detail on other potential affects of the agreement on organic farms and farming in Wales. Although the major decision in Wales has been made – that the Single Farm Payment (SFP) will be on the ‘historic’ basis – many details of the implementation of the SFP are still being clarified in Brussels. Therefore, this document is for guidance ONLY, on OCW’s current understanding and interpretation of the Regulation, and will be subject to updates as more information becomes available.</dc:description>
