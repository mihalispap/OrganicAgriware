  <dc:description>This report presents result of research on the financial performance of organic farms in 2006/07 and 2007/08, carried out for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). &#xD;
This research builds on previous work on the economics of organic farming carried out at Aberystwyth University (Projects OF0190, covering 1995/96 to 1998/99 and OF0189, covering 1999/00 to 2004/05)1.&#xD;
Overall, identicla samples examined over a two year period 2006/07 to 2007/08 show that most organic sectors achieved higher net farm incomes in 2007/08 LFA cattle and sheep farm Net Farm Income (NFI) had the greatest increase,gaining by 46%, with strong gains in cropping and dairying. Organic mixed farming was the only sector to see reduced profitability, the identical sample falling back by 10%, while lowland cattle and sheep farming NFI increased by only 10%. When compared with comparable conventional farms, all organic farming sectors except poultry were above conventional profitability levels in 2007/08.</dc:description>
