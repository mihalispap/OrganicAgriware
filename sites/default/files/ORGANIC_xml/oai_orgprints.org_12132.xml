  <dc:description>Values are at the centre of organic farming. The paper examines ethical concerns that are important to consumers, producers and other stakeholders in relation to organic farming practice and how this relates to current standards and the four IFOAM principles of health, ecology, fairness and care. Most concerns can be categorised under four headings but important issues are cross cutting. Currently, standards cover, both directly and indirectly, only a part of ethical values associated with organic food and agriculture but many producers aim to deliver on a broader range.</dc:description>
