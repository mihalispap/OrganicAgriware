  <dc:description>Selection of cereal varieties suited to organic farming requires a different, but complementary, approach to that used when developing cereals for conventional high input systems. Selection is based on the interaction between a series of desirable plant and crop characteristics, in particular competitive ability against weeds. Certain key characteristics that are generically desirable for organic cereal varieties include: (1 good establishment ability, (2) high tillering ability, (3) increasing plant height, (4) planophile leaf habit, (5) high leaf index and (6) robustnesses in yield performance across sites. Our data strongly suggest that high crop ground cover is the most important feature for creating a highly competitive crop that also has consistency in yield. Individual plant or crop traits in (1) to (5) can be used to define plant growth habits. A scheme for assessing growth habits in new varieties is presented.</dc:description>
