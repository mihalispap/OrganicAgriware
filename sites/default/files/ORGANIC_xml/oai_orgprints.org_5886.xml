  <dc:description>The paper contributes to the understanding of change to sustainable agriculture at the farm level, arguing that variability and length and of the process, in terms of farmersâ€™ decision-making and the impact on farms, need to be recognised. Potential variables influencing the process of conversion to organic farming, and key stages of Adoption are reviewed, with particular focus on how farmers evaluate and experience systems change and the relevance of the Adoption/Diffusion model. This is contrasted with observations of the conversion to organic milk production on case farms in the UK. Three key stages of such change processes are conceptualised, and the relevance of such a framework for research and support of farmers during periods of change is discussed.</dc:description>
