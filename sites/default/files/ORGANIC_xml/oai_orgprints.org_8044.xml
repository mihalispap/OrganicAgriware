  <dc:description>Danish environmental regulations require farmers to grow catch crops on their fields. Many farmers have been hostile to this, and seen it only as an extra cost and extra work. The paper deals with the advantages farmers can get from growing catch crops, and how they grow them in the best way. Species choice, rooting depth, winter hardiness, establishment methods are discussed as parameters to use for optimization of the result. It is argued that in many cases growing catch crops is not only to the advantage of the environment, but may also be of advantage to the farmers.</dc:description>
