  <dc:description>Results from model estimations based on existing data on gene dispersal in oilseed rape indicate that the GM dispersal by pollen to organic fields primarily can be limited by the use of isolation distances. The results also indicate that because of pollen dilution, large fields are better protected from GM pollen dispersal than smaller fields. For large fields (i.e. field width &gt; 200 m), the risk of dispersal from GM fields by pollen will be limited (approx. 0.1%) at distances above 100 m. For small fields (i.e. width = 50 m), some GM pollen dispersal (up to approx. 0.3%) may be expected even with an isolation distance of 200 m. If the fields are very close, the use of additional protective buffer zones may be required.</dc:description>
