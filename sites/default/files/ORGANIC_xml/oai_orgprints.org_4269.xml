  <dc:description>Pigs inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium were grouped with non-infected tracerpigs to determine the transmission of salmonella between organic outdoor animals. The results indicated that the organic pigs were perceptive to infections but that the susceptibility varied considerably between pigs. Bacteriological examinations of soil and water samples from the pasture environment showed the ability of salmonella to survive in the non-host environment, and under some favoruable conditions pose an infection risk for new pigs introduced onto the contaminated pastures.</dc:description>
