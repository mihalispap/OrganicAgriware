  <dc:description>Phosphorus (P) conservation and the environmental, ecological and economic issues related to over-use and under-use of P on organic farms are addressed. Re-examination of Certification Standards is recommended to ensure the conservation and efficient use of P through adaptation of organic management to local conditions, ecology, culture and scale. Changes that will conserve P and minimise environmental risk are identified, along with the necessary research to make this possible.</dc:description>
