  <dc:description>The 2010&#xD;
growing season was exceptionally warm and most cultivars performed well, except Sovereign and&#xD;
Sedley that lodged and matured late. There were significant differences in earliness (P&lt;0.001), the&#xD;
earliest cultivar being Rosetown (901 GDD to maturity), and the latest Sedley (1214 GDD). There&#xD;
were no significant differences in yield (P=0.111), the average being 1.49 t/ha. Cultivar Meteor was&#xD;
the highest yielding with 1.86 t/ha but it lodged, whereas cvs Redbow, Redcoat, Rosetown and&#xD;
Milestone yielded between 1.5â€“1.6 t/ha and showed few problems in cultivation, so further&#xD;
experiments will focus on them. In conclusion, lentil cultivation is feasible in Finland, and further&#xD;
trials will be run in 2011.</dc:description>
