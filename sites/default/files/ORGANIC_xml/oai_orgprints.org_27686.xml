  <dc:description>The publication examines  possibilities to integrate the statutory school food provided by the municipals in to the educational goals of schools are discussed. &#xD;
The sustainability concept as perceived and implemented by the actors of the municipal catering sector and by the teachers of basic education in Finland are captured via questionnaires directed to each of the   groups.  The information retrieved from the questionnaires is complemented with analysis of school curricula.&#xD;
Participatory action research involving teachers, caterers and researchers are suggested to provide one promising channel for finding the local way to implement food education for sustainability. This would convey the empowerment of both groups of professionals in their efforts for sustainable food culture.</dc:description>
