  <dc:description>In 2002 KWS SAAT AG took a conventional arable farm on lease and converted it to organic farming. Management is done by the daughter company KWS Klostergut Wiebrechtshausen GmbH. Due to EC-regulation 2091/92 and additionally to the guidelines of Naturland farming is performed.&#xD;
The farm is aimed to produce seed (cereal, potato). Furthermore varieties and lines of different crops of the KWS group are tested on their suitability in organic farming. A specific breeding program for organic corn varieties is running.&#xD;
Wiebrechtshausen is a location of the official variety trials in Lower Saxony.&#xD;
The farm is involved in permanent investigations on seed treatment of various crops (cereals, corn, sugar beet) and in a two-years program on organic sugar beet growing.</dc:description>
