  <dc:description>Organic certification represents different functions for the stakeholders involved in this process. For a producer of organic food, it is mainly a service provided by a certification body. Hardly any information currently exists on organic operators’ satisfaction with this service. In a survey of German organic processors, we examine the satisfaction and other questions connected to the relationship certification body – client and offer insights for certification bodies and organic associations.</dc:description>
