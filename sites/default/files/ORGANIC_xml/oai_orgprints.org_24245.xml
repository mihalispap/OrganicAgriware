  <dc:subject>Farm nutrient management</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>In this study, it was aimed to compare the yield and quality, micro and macro element contents of leaves in vineyards plantations where conventional and organic farming systems.&#xD;
The experiment was carried out  in 5 replicates completely randomized design in Manisa Salihli Poyrazdamları Village in 9 year long between 2000-2008. According to soil analysis results, certified fertilizer and green manure and ground pruned branches were applied as plant nutrition material in organic plots. On the other hand, 21% ammonium sulphate, 26% ammonium nitrate, 43% triple super phosphate as P2O5 and 48-52% potassium sulphate as K2O were applied in conventional plots. Certified products and traps permitted in the related regulations, were used as plant protection material in organic plots. In conventional plots, synthetic chemicals were used. According to soil analysis results, there were no changes in saturation, salinity and lime values in both farming system.  In conventional plots, phosphorus level was increased whereas pH level was decreaed. Seemingly, organic matter was higher in conventional plots, but due to high microbiological and enzyme activities, lower levels of organic matter were determined in organic plots. There was no deficiency of Fe, Cu and Mn values of soil microelements in both system. However Zn values were in low levels at first years of the experiment, than the values increased gradually in both system. N, P, Cu, Mn and Zn microelements values of leaves were not statistically different between the systems. K, Ca, Mg and Fe values were statistically different between the systems. While table fruit yields and raisin were statistically different, higher in conventional plots. Of fruit quality criteria pH, water soluable dry matter were not significant, hundred grain weight, yield and quality classes of raisin were significant.</dc:description>
