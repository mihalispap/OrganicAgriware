  <dc:description>454-sequencing of the genome was used to isolate and characterize nuclear 22 microsatellite sequences from the ground beetle Bembidion lampros (Carabidae). A 23 total of 4502 contigs containing di- to penta-nucleotide microsatellite repeats were 24 found (4211 perfect and 289 non-perfect repeats). Primers were developed and tested 25 for 34 microsatellite sequences. Of these 15 were tested on 1140 individual samples 26 amplifying on average 89% of samples and they did not deviate significantly from 27 Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium. These microsatellite sequences will be useful 28 in studying the effect of agricultural management techniques and various environmental 29 factors on a beneficial agricultural species.</dc:description>
