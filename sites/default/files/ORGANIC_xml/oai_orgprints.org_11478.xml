  <dc:description>The effects of crop type, and of fertility and crop protection management within crops, on ground beetle species activity were investigated using the Nafferton Factorial Systems Comparison Experiment, using pitfall traps in 2005. Thirteen species gave significant responses to crop type, with seven showing a preference for cereals and none for grass/clover. There were 22 significant responses to fertility and six to crop protection within crop types. Sixteen of the responses to fertility and four to crop protection resulted in more activity in organically managed plots. Fertility effects were found most in wheat, barley and grass/clover whilst crop protection effects were mainly in beans and vegetables. A better knowledge of the effects of fertility management is required following changes from conventional to organic farming.</dc:description>
