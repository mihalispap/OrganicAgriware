  <dc:description>A field experiment was conducted at Kwara State University Teaching and Research Farm, Malete, Kwara State, Nigeria to evaluate the performance of different rates of Jathropha seed cake on the growth and yield of Amaranthus caudatus. The five treatments tested were; 3 Jathropha seed cake application rates (2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 t/ha), NPK at 100kg N/ha and control. The treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Growth and yield parameters such as plant height, number of leaves, stem girth and fresh weight were taken. The results (p&lt;0.05) indicated that application of Jathropha seed cake at 2.5 t/ha produced taller plants more profuse leaves and higher shoot fresh weight compared to NPK or the control treatment. In conclusion, Jathropha seed cake at 2.5 t/ha could be good alternatives to NPK fertilizer in raising leafy vegetable.</dc:description>
