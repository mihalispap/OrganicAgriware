  <dc:description>N2-fixing and P-solubilizing bacteria are important in plant nutrition increasing N and P uptake by the plants, and playing a significant role as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) in the biofertilization of crops. In 2007 and 2008, a field study was conducted in two different locations (Erzurum and Ispir) in the Eastern part of Turkey for investigating the effects of two N2-fixing and P-solubilizing PGPR strains alone and in combinations on plant yield and nutrient content of wheat in comparison to control and optimum and half doses of N fertilizer application under field condition. All inoculations and fertilizer applications significantly increased grain, total biomass yields, and macro and micro nutrients of wheat over the control. Mixed PGPR inoculations with the strain of OSU-142 + M3 + Azospirillum sp.245 has significantly increased grain yield of wheat as good as full doses of nitrogen. All bacterial inoculations, especially mixed inoculation, significantly increased uptake of macro-nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) and micro-nutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu) of grain, leaf, and straw part of the plant. The data suggested that seed inoculation with OSU-142 + M3 + Azospirillum sp.245 may substitute N and P fertilizers in wheat production.</dc:description>
