  <dc:description>The launch of Agriecol Thematic Network has strengthened communication between the research groups working in the field of organic farming and the economic and social sector (companies, associations and groups of organic agriculture and livestock, including forest systems and their use by organic production techniques, and the production and processing of organic food). This paper aims to show the activities of the Agriecol to increase national and international presence of the network in order to establish synergies with organic sector and with leading research groups working on organic farming worldwide.</dc:description>
