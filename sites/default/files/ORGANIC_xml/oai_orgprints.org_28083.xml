  <dc:description>The global Organic market for food has expanded to upwards of US$ 60 billion in consumer purchases annually. However, the market is concentrated in only a few countries, mostly in Europe and North America, and the global market share is far below 1%. We need further developments if the aspirations of the Organic World to provide solutions to global challenges are to be realized. The market and the attractiveness of Organic products on the market are changing, so that we need to adapt. The positioning of Organic products in the various markets, the responses of the Organic Sector to upcoming concerns, the transparency of processes and products, and the reporting of impacts are issues to which marketers need to be up to date.</dc:description>
