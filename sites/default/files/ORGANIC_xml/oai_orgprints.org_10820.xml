  <dc:description>The development of biogas technology in Denmark has been widely encouraged by the government over the last 15 years. The overall reasons for the government concern has been the increasing awareness that centralised biogas plants make a significant contribution to solve a range of problems in the fields of energy, agriculture and environment. This has been documented through related monitoring and R &amp; D activities. To achieve a satisfactory evaluation of centralised biogas plants, a thorough socio â€“ economic analysis is required. Such investigation has been accomplished, and the results are presented in this summary.</dc:description>
