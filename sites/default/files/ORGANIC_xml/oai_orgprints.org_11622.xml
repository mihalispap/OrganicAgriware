  <dc:description>After a completed rotation of seven years, soils of the Manure as a Chance (MAC) trial were analysed for the effect of organic amendments on soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Yields suggest significant differences due to different organic amendments after seven years. In treatments receiving farm yard manure and bio waste compost yields increased over time. Soil properties indicate changes in soil carbon, nitrogen mineralization en plant feeding nematodes due to different organic amendments. No significant changes in microbial and fungal biomass were found.</dc:description>
