  <dc:description>Never before the subject of Landscaping is covered in any of the past IFOAM Conferences. BIODYNAMIC Landscape Garden Designing is a new approach for Urban Landscaping where purposeful plantations are carried out, incorporating the science of BIOENERGETICS (measuring the energies in Plants, trees, and Earth Energies) which are also useful as Therapeutic (Healing) Gardens, suitable for Health Care institutes, Residential Complexes and Educational Institutions. The conventional approach is to follow the chemical methods, but the purpose of this presentation is to introduce the innovative technology of BIOPONIC1 method. This can inspire and give a new direction to the Landscape Architects and Garden Contractors in designing Urban Landscapes.</dc:description>
