  <dc:description>On April 19th, 2006, the 100 delegates of Bio Suisse, the Swiss organic umbrella organization, voted to ban Hybrid varieties in organic cereals (except maize). This decision primarily concerns rye. Organic rye is grown on only 250 ha, about 20% of which is sown to hybrid varieties at present. About 60% of total organic demand is imported. Hybrid varieties of the other cereals are not yet being grown. The delegates decided that it is time to act now to send a signal to breeders and to the international organic community before the alternatives to hybrids vanish.</dc:description>
