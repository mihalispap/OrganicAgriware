  <dc:description>The aim of this study conducted at the experimental farm in Scheyern, was to investigate whether earthworm population in different habitats and under different farming systems (organic vs. integrated) differs. Arable land was compared with alley cropping systems, with meadows and field margins. For comparison purpose there were also investigations on the natural habitats fallow, forest and forest edge. The field study yielded the following results: In the meadow, the tree row in the alley cropping system and in the natural reference habitats (with exception of the studied forest), the abundance and species diversity was enhanced compared with arable land. In addition the tree rows in the alley cropping system had a positive effect on the earthworm population. The arable fields in the alley cropping system stood out due to higher abundance and species diversity compared to similar arable land without tree row. Moreover, differences in the earthworm population became apparent in the consequence of organic or integrated farming. In all habitat types higher earthworm abundance was found in the organic farming system. Concerning species diversity, the results differed from each other in the different habitats.</dc:description>
