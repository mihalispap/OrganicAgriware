  <dc:description>Rodent control is important from a food safety perspective, especially on organic farms. However, extermination using cats and poison have their disadvantages. Therefore we were searching for a better method of rodent control on organic farms. Live-traps might be an alternative: it fits better in the organic philosophy. But does it work? In this study we compared application of poison with use of live-traps by determining their efficacies on 20 organic pig farms. We found no difference between treatments, thus live-traps can form an alternative for poison.</dc:description>
