  <dc:title>2014 Organic Farm Management Handbook</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Farm economics</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The handbook provides information on the costs and performance of organic farms and related management issues, up-to-date business management information for farmers, advisers and others concerned with the management of organic farms. It is intended for use in conjunction with similar handbooks for agriculture in general. &#xD;
The handbook include chapters on marketing, conversion, whole farm planning and grants as well as gross margins for arable crops, horticulture, forage/green manures and livestock enterprises, and sources of further information. &#xD;
The information presented is based on historical data and estimates for the coming season in the UK. Data are estimates of what an average farmer, given adequate resources, might expect to achieve but are representative.  &#xD;
&#xD;
The 10th edition provides an update on CAP reform developments and the likely shape of schemes to come, as well as an update on the UK organic market.</dc:description>
