  <dc:description>Polyphenolic compounds are measured in carrots. Beside measurements of total phenolic contents (TPC) as a sum parameter, HPLC methods are developed and validated to detect the single constituents. The methods are applied for carrot samples from different field experiments as well as farming systems. The aim of the experiments is to test if:&#xD;
1.	carrot samples from different treatments can be differentiated &#xD;
2.	the sum parameters are correlated with the HPLC data (single constituents)&#xD;
3.	the application of multivariate statistics can help to classify the samples according to their treatment</dc:description>
