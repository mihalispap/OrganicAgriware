  <dc:description>True bugs (Hemiptera; Heteroptera) are important pests in fruit production in Norway. In organic fruit production&#xD;
they may damage up to 40% of the crop. Several of the Heteropteran species attacking apple and pear&#xD;
are polyphagous, with many other hostplants than pome fruit. In organic production few control methods are&#xD;
available against bugs. In this study we have tried a cultural control method (mowing of groundcover) as well&#xD;
as spray applications of various biological insecticides against bugs. Spray application of azadirachtin (NeemAzal),&#xD;
rape oil and garlic extract (Ecoguard) were tested. Results indicate that the effect of mowing groundcover&#xD;
inside the orchard is variable and small. Applying NeemAzal reduced the number of bugs and damage.&#xD;
Oil and Ecoguard showed little effect in this study, however further testing is needed. Results from the first&#xD;
two years of the study will be discussed in relation to both cultural and direct control methods against bugs.</dc:description>
