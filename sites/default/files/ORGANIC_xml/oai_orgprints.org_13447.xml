  <dc:description>Following two milk studies performed by the Louis Bolk Instituut, the hypothesis that processing of milk has an important effect on bio crystallisation pictures was investigated. Two raw whole milk tank  samples,  coded A and B, and 5 treatments performed on these samples (in total A/B 1-6) were offered for analysis. Evaluation was performed Visually and by means of computerized Texture analysis.  &#xD;
Conclusions: Processing of milk has a strong effect on the crystallisation pictures. Especially homogenisation of milk had a large impact on the crystallisation picture. Surprisingly, this influence is higher than the treatment with ultra high temperatures at 140C.</dc:description>
