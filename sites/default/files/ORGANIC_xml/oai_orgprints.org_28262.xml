  <dc:description>Hulled wheat species (einkorn, emmer, spelt) are presumed to be an alternative to bread wheat in organic agriculture since the yield penalty is less pronounced under organic farming and generally higher prices can be achieved for specialty grains. The present study analyzed differences between wheat species with respect to biomass production, harvest index, grain yield and protein content. Spring hulled wheat genetic resources and bread wheat check cultivars were grown in organic field trials in the Czech Republic and Austria between 2010 and 2012. Generally, hulled wheat species were inferior in grain yield and distribution of assimilates to the grain compared to modern bread wheat. Biomass production of some emmer and spelt landraces was similar to bread wheat. A higher protein content (+3â€“6 %) was observed for spelt, however, considering protein yield the differences between spelt and bread wheat became less pronounced. With respect to the recent high market demand for spelt and the absence of available spring grown varieties some of the landraces were identified as valuable resources for the development of spring spelt varieties suitable for organic farming.</dc:description>
