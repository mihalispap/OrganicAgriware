  <dc:description>For organic poultry production to increase, suitable solutions must be available for disease preventions and control that meet organic standards. The purpose of the present work was to discuss progress being made in evaluating the potential for utilizing cranberry as an immune-modulatory agent in organic broiler chickens production. Investigations on cranberry compounds could lead to the development of a feeding strategy for organic chicken production to improve the bird health and immunity and on-farm food safety while reducing use of antibiotics (in conventional operations). Based on the above data, it is clear that additional research will unlock the full potential of cranberry and other fruits pomaces and how best to use them as feed ingredient for organic chicken producers.</dc:description>
