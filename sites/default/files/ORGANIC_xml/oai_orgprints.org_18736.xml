  <dc:description>This article deals with ethical activities that are going beyond the organic regulations (referred to as 'organicPlus' in this study) and their communication strategies practised by organic farms and enterprises. The results are based on a qualitative survey of 100 organic small and medium-sized enterprises/farms in five European countries. Their engagement can be perceived in a certain sense as an opposite trend of the ongoing conventionalisation process in the organic sector. The organicPlus activities are related to the three classical sustainability dimensions extended by a cultural dimension. All enterprises/farms represent unique approaches with more or less professional communication strategies and a local or regional orientation. Therefore they have the potential to contribute to social capital, to build new local networks and to influence local structures. The organicPlus activities and the communication arguments are diverse as well as the motivations behind them. Open questions are if these organicPlus activities have the potential to contribute to a change of values and organic practices in the national and international context.</dc:description>
