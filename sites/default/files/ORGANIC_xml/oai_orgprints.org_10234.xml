  <dc:description>The small organic arable sector in N. Ireland could be expanded to provide winter feed for cattle. Spring barley or wheat are likely to be the most suitable crops as they are reported to have fewer weed and disease problems than winter cereals. Trials from 2003 â€“05 on weed control showed no consistent effect of cultivar, although higher seed rates reduced weed biomass and tended to increase yield, albeit marginally. Trials on disease control showed no synergistic effects of two- or three-way cultivar mixtures over single cultivars, although disease levels were generally low. Particularly in spring barley, results from mixtures tended to be averages of those of individual components. It is suggested that it may be more advantageous and practical to use the most highly-disease resistant or tolerant cultivars rather than concentrate on mixtures.</dc:description>
