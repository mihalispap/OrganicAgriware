  <dc:title>Hansalim Organic Cooperative – A Best Practice Model of Direct Sales between Farmers and Consumers</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>Chang, Jennifer</dc:creator>
  <dc:subject>Markets and trade</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Hansalim is leading cooperative in South Korea promoting  “direct sales movement between the rural and the urban areas” of organic food. Farmers sell directly to Hansalim through contract farming and get back 76% from the sales price as sales do not go through any middle-persons. &#xD;
&#xD;
Hansalim is a model of mutual trust between farmers and consumers – “farmers shoulder the responsibility of the health of the consumers while consumers shoulder the livelihoods of the farmers”. Consumers regularly visit the farms and the food that they get on the table “comes with a face”- that of the farmers who produce them.</dc:description>
