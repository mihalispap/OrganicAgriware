  <dc:description>In order to obtain a high and stable yield of organic spring barley, production should be optimized according to the specific environment. To test the performance of spring barley varieties under varying cropping conditions, a field experiment was carried out in 2003 and 2004 in a six-field mixed organic crop rotation. We investigated the choice of variety, the order in a rotation,and the application of manure (slurry and farm yard manure; 0 to 120 total-Nha�1) on grain yields of six selected varieties with different characteristics grown in either pure stands or in two spring barley mixtures, each consisting of three varieties. &#xD;
&#xD;
Average grain yield of the barley varieties varied between 3.3 t DM ha-�1 and 4.1 t DM ha-�1. Grain yields of the two mixtures were 4.0 and 3.6 t DM ha-�1, respectively. The varieties/mixtures interacted with crop order and year. Foliar diseases were more severe in the barley following grass-clover with large annual differences in the individual diseases. Despite different rooting depths and nutrient uptake patterns, there was no interaction between variety/mixture and the manure input regarding grainyield. In the 1st year after grass-clover, one of the two mixtures gave higher grain yield than the average yield of the individual varieties in the mixture. This was not the case in the 4th year after grass-clover and for the second variety mixture. Thus, although the present results did not indicate that some barley varieties were better adapted to conditions with low manure input than others, variety mixtures that give a robust and stable organic production may potentially be developed.</dc:description>
