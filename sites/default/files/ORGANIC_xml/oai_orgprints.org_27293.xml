  <dc:description>The present experiment shows that there are no drawbacks in finishing young bull calves for 6 weeks on purely grass sward or purely herb-based sward in comparison with concentrates when it comes to meat and eating quality &#xD;
› The meat of grass- and herbs-fed calves has similar colour and sensory profile&#xD;
› Herbs has a positive effect on the ‘health-related’ quality as herbs increase the content of vitamins A and E, linoleic and α-linolenic acid and improves the n-6 :n-3 ratio</dc:description>
