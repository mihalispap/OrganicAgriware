  <dc:description>The objective of this paper is to analyze empirically factors that explain organic food purchase behaviour, using data on a representative sample of inhabitants of Czech Republic. First, socio-demographic characteristics of organic food consumers are examined. Second, the motivational factors and barriers that affect purchase decision-making related to organic food are identified.The results of the study show that organic food is purchased more likely by younger households, households from larger cities and households with the highest income. Health-related beliefs, environmental beliefs, and normative beliefs have positive effect on organic food purchase. On the other hand, low trust in certification system, lack of information and perceived shorter shelf life of organics are the important barriers to organic food consumption.</dc:description>
