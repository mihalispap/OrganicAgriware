  <dc:description>Field experiments were conducted in three successive growing seasons (2002/03 to 2004/05) at different sites within Europe. Treatments included wheat intercropped with faba bean in both replacement and additive designs, both autumn and spring sowing, and at one site, wheat intercropped with pea. Irrespective of design, sowing season, site, or grain legume used, intercropping increased the N and S concentration, and the N:S ratio in  wheat grain.</dc:description>
