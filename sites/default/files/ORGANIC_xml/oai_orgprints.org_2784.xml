  <dc:description>1. This study examined whether a free range with roofed boxes with sand to structure the hen run had an effect on the numbers of hens going outside and on the distribution of the hens in the hen run.&#xD;
2. On a poultry farm with 8 flocks of laying hens of roughly 500 birds per flock, each flock was observed with and without roofed boxes with sand.&#xD;
3. There was no difference in the number of hens on free range with and without roofed boxes but there was an influence on the distribution.&#xD;
4. In free range with structures there was a higher percentage of the hens outside in the furthest quarter where the structures were located.&#xD;
5. We conclude that structures in the free range have an effect on the distribution of laying hens.</dc:description>
