  <dc:description>Farming since 1983, Vehbi Ersoz always thought there were some problems with the conventional farming methods. Using a different pesticide for each varmint and a different fertilizer for each missing substance in the soil made him question the function and procedures in conventional agriculture. Favoring a more holistic perspective in agriculture, he tried many methods to enrich the soil and increase the soil microorganisms, which in turn do the actual work. In his region he brought many leading and innovative techniques to life. Some of them are greenhouse farming, organic farming, biodynamic agriculture and Shumei method of agriculture. As a side benefit of applying many different techniques, he discovered that methods applied in one philosophy, may in fact be applied and can be useful in a different&#xD;
philosophy.</dc:description>
