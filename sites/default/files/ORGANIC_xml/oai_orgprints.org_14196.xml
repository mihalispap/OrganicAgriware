  <dc:description>Fair trade conditions not only in intercontinental trade but also for European farmers&#xD;
are currently widely discussed. A successful example is the Producer-Fair-Milk-&#xD;
Initiative of the Hessian dairy Upländer Bauernmolkerei. Started in 2005, organic&#xD;
buyers are asked to pay an extra 5 eurocent per litre milk, which is transferred to the&#xD;
dairy’s farmers. The aim of this paper is to analyse consumer knowledge on the initiative&#xD;
and to investigate the most important buying motives for fair milk products.&#xD;
Furthermore, the importance consumers attach to the initiative’s central motives ‘fair&#xD;
prices’, ‘organic’ and ‘regional production’ is determined by asking them for their additional&#xD;
willingness to pay for these attributes of milk.&#xD;
By means of a standardised questionnaire 577 consumers were interviewed in six&#xD;
organic food shops and 565 interviews were statistically evaluated. The results illustrate&#xD;
that the central motives of the initiative are well known by a majority of consumers&#xD;
and represent important buying motives for these milk products. The dairy seems to&#xD;
be very successful in communicating the initiative’s objectives. Many organic consumers&#xD;
claim to be willing to pay higher prices for specific attributes. Communication of&#xD;
‘fair prices’, ‘GMO-free’, ‘food quality’ and ‘regional production’ may offer promising&#xD;
product differentiation possibilities for organic farmers as well as processors.</dc:description>
