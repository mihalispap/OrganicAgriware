  <dc:description>Andalusia Organic production has increased so much during latest years due to the sector effort and because of the Andalusian Organic Farming Plan. This Plan has been developed by Andalusain Government and carried out by oficial instruments in order to achieve some economical, social and environmental targets. Results of measures developed during 2005 have shown a great response from stakeholders. Main objective has been to organise farmers production internally to the local market in regions and creation of cooperatives and organic industries. Participatory actions have been the principal axes for research and new local regulations on organic farming.</dc:description>
