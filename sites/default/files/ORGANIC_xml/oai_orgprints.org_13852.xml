  <dc:description>Soil-borne pathogens, above all Verticillium sp. cause plant losses and yield decreases in many Austrian&#xD;
strawberry fields, also in organic farming systems; in a research project possibilities to resolve this problem&#xD;
were examined. In a field trial, which was started 1998, organically managed and differently fertilized plots&#xD;
(green compost, manure, hornchips) were compared to an unfertilised control plot and to two mineral&#xD;
fertilized and conventionally treated plots; the differences in field characteristics of strawberries in 2004 and&#xD;
2005 were low, but differences in storage and biochemical characteristics could be seen in 2005. Some new&#xD;
cultivars tested as alternative to the very sensitive 'Elsanta' planted in 2005 on several farms showed a&#xD;
higher tolerance to diseases and good yield and fruit quality characteristics. Brassica sp. planted as an&#xD;
intercrop before strawberries reduced the amount of microsclerotia of Verticillium dahliae in highly infested&#xD;
soils, nevertheless the system has to be optimised and adapted to our climatic and husbandry conditions in&#xD;
further trials.</dc:description>
