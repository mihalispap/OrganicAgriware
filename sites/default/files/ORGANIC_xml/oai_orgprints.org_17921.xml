  <dc:description>Organic agriculture continues to develop dynamically in Europe. In most countries the organic area is on the increase and the market continues to grow. This positive development is also due to several policy support measures; such as funding under rural development programmes, legal protection, action plans as well as support for research and advice The organic sector, represented by the EU Group of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM EU Group), plays an important role in the development of organic food and farming in Europe.</dc:description>
