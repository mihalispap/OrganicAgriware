  <dc:description>Specific conditions of organic farming are often limited nitrogen supply and – depending on the year - early occurrence of P. infestans. In addition, genetic (variety) and environmental (site, year) factors may have strong effects on both the yield and quality of tubers with regard to their suitability for processing. This study examined the impact of variety and site on the yield structure and quality of tubers for processing to chips at three sites over two years. According to the results, the varieties Agria and Marena with high yield and good quality after harvesting and storage were interesting for organic farmers.</dc:description>
