  <dc:description>The study of 740 Estonian  occasional consumers has shown that 60 % of them are willing to buy organic products  mainly because these contain fewer additives than conventional products. Therefore the consumers  consider them first of all more natural and healthier. Preferred products are organic  vegetables and  fruits.   Consumers prefer to buy  them from supermarkets. Common awareness about organic farming needs improvement â€“ only 11% of consumers felt themselves entirely informed.</dc:description>
