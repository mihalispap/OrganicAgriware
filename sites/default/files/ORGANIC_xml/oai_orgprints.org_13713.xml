  <dc:description>Entomopathogenic nematodes are often found naturally infecting codling moth larvae. The&#xD;
effect of an autumn treatment with S. feltiae on the fruit damage in the following summer&#xD;
was evaluated by treating 4 different apple orchards in October 2004 and 2005 at&#xD;
application rates of 3.75; 2 and 1.5 billion nematodes in 4000 l / ha. In three of the treated&#xD;
orchards, one treated with 3.75x109 nematodes/ha the other two treated with 2e9&#xD;
nematode/ha, reduction in fruit damage was around 50%. In the most heavily infested&#xD;
orchard, which was treated with 1.5x109 nematode/ha only 33% reduction in fruit damage&#xD;
was achieved. Compared to previous studies, this was the first assessing the effect on the&#xD;
fruit damage in the summer following the treatment rather than assessing the mortality of&#xD;
sentinel larvae fixed to the treated tree trunks.</dc:description>
