  <dc:description>Growth of the organic food market slowed in 2009 in response to global economic stresses. Markets in Europe were more affected than in the USA, but sales still expanded in these two dominant markets. Organic fruit and vegetable sales in the USA maintained about 11% growth from 2008 to 2011. Overall, the global area of organic fruit (converted and in conversion) was over 648,000 ha in 2010, accounting for 7% of organically-managed arable and permanent crop land. Leading fruits were grapes and tropical and subtropical fruits, accounting for 34 and 29% of all organic fruit area in 2010. An estimated 56% of the total world organic fruit production area was in Europe, with grapes the leading crop. Over 6% of the grape hectarage in Italy was certified organic or in conversion; organic grapes accounted for 3% of all grape hectarage worldwide. Organic fruit area expanded 54% between 2006 and 2010, similar to a 58% growth in consumer demand for organic fruits and produce. Organic shares of global fruit area ranged from 0.7% (citrus, stone) to 5.8% (berries). Percent growth of organic fruit area typically outpaced conventional fruit area, and organic fruit area expanded faster than overall organic cropland area.</dc:description>
