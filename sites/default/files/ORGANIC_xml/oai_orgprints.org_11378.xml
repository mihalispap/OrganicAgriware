  <dc:description>Five durum wheat cultivars were grown in a Mediterranean area (Southern Italy) under conventional and organic farming with&#xD;
the aim to evaluate agronomic, technological, sensory, and sanitary quality of grains and pasta. The cultivar Matt produced the&#xD;
best pasta quality under conventional cropping system, while the quality parameters evaluated were unsatisfactory under organic&#xD;
farming. The cultivar Saragolla showed the best yield amount and pasta quality in all the experimental conditions, thus proving&#xD;
to be the cultivar more adapt to organic farming. In all the tested experimental conditions, nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol&#xD;
(DON) occurrence was very low and the other mycotoxins evaluated were completely absent. These data conÔ¨Årm the low risk of&#xD;
mycotoxin contamination in the Mediterranean climate conditions. Finally, it has been possible to produce high-quality pasta in&#xD;
Southern Italy from durum wheat grown both in conventional and organic farming.</dc:description>
