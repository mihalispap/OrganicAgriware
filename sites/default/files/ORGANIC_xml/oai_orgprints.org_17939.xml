  <dc:description>There is a paradigm shift needed in standard setting towards assessing progress rather than failure. Such systems needs good subject-related principles and objectives (e.g. for good animal housing). These need to be linked to decision criteria and suitable indicators, possibly more outcome and development-oriented. Assessment systems and Code(s) of (best) Practices should be developed by researchers, advisers and practitioners as complementary tools for re-oriented progress certification.</dc:description>
