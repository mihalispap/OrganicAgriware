  <dc:description>Organic systems aim to operate in an ecological and economical way, importing cereals grown thousands of miles away, processed at a mill and then transported again to our farms is costly in oil and therefore money. It is neither ecologically nor economically sustainable. British farms are capable of producing a large amount of high quality cereal, the majority of which is usually sold. Transportation and processing of the grain uses oil and leaves farms vulnerable to market prices.&#xD;
If farmers could formulate diets and feeding programmes for their poultry and pig systems using home-grown cereals, market variables, oil emissions and costs could be cut dramatically.</dc:description>
