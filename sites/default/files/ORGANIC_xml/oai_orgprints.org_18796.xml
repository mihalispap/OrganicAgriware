  <dc:description>This note is intended to provide a basis for internal discussion among CONCEPTS partners. The issue addressed concerns the employment of a distinction between two modes of conceiving organic products among consumers. A distinction between an "integral" and a "diffuse" mode plays a central role in the project’s Technical Annex, both in descriptions of the objectives of particular tasks/work packages and in the preliminary titles of planned publications.</dc:description>
