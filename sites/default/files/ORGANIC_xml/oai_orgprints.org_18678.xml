  <dc:title>The role of clover in organic milk production</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Relatively high levels of milk output are possible from organic clover-based grassland compared with average production on conventional dairy farms in Ireland. Although clover-based swards receiving no fertilizer have relatively low growth in spring, a long grazing season can be achieved by extending the grazing season during the autumn and winter. High growth rates during the summer and autumn and relatively low stocking densities on organic dairy farms facilitate this. Maintaining the clover content of swards is important to maintain productivity. Tight grazing to 4 cm throughout the year and particularly during the late autumn and winter is important. Identifying swards with declining clover contents due to competition from the grass component of the sward or due to hoof damage is also important. These swards need to be over- sown the following year with the target of over-sowing or re-seeding no less than 20% of the farm each year.</dc:description>
