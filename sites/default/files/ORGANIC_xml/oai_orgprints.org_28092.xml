  <dc:subject>"Organics" in general</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Organic is not the only initiative with the aim of improving sustainability in agriculture. There is a wide array of approaches, perspectives, priorities and levels of ambition. Certain initiatives are seen as complimentary to Organic Agriculture and use it as a basis. Others are viewed as followers, competitors or â€“ due to lower sustainability requirements â€“ even as "greenwashers". As not all assessments of standards and impacts recognize a leading position for Organic farming, there is room for improvement.</dc:description>
