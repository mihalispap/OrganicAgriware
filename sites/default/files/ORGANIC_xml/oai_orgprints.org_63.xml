  <dc:description>Abstract: The primary data source in this project is GfK – ConsumerScan (Dansk HusstandsPanel). Each week households in the panel report their shopping to GfK, and states whether each good purchased is organic or conventional. This paper explains the nature and contents of the panel data. It gives a general overview of the information available in the data, as well as examples of the data recorded by GfK. In addition to data of household purchases, GfK has the following background information on households: Demographic and socio-economic characteristics, attitudes to food and shopping, eating patterns and media habits. We have access to these data at a very detailed level starting in 1997.</dc:description>
