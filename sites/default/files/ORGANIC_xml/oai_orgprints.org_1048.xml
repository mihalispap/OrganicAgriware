  <dc:description>Organic farming research has been developed over 4 stages: &#xD;
&#xD;
i) Pioneer farmers and scientists, &#xD;
ii) pioneer private research institutes, &#xD;
iii) organic farming chairs at universities and finally &#xD;
iv) organic farming projects and institutes at state research institutions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Today, organic agriculture has become finally accepted within agriculture and food research. The main key players in organic research in Europe are mentioned in the text.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mainly in Europe, public funded research has shifted towards organic farming, whereas the research resources for conventional farming have been cut down considerably. &#xD;
&#xD;
The paper gives an overview of the current status and the future prospects of organic farming research in Europe.</dc:description>
