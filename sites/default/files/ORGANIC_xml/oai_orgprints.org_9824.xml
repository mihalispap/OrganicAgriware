  <dc:description>Consumersâ€™ perception of health related to food products, characteristics, ingredients and attributes is measured in a qualitative and quantitative approach. Cognitive aspects as well as affective aspects are taken in consideration. &#xD;
In the perspective of health perception consumers talk in terms of unprocessed, nutritious, fresh, and natural attributes, as well as affective aspects like appetizing, happy and enjoy. Different groups of consumers have their own perception of health. Depending the target group and the product the health perception of consumers is correlated to specific attributes and affective aspects.</dc:description>
