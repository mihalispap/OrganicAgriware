  <dc:description>As a fast growing state sponsored industry, the organic food sector is likely to attract the increased attention of policy analysts who are interested in industry development. We critically review the European comparative research on growth in the organic sector, focusing on policy analysis. A common element in these accounts is that findings are by no means clear on why variation in organic growth between countries exists. The literature provides a range of possible variables explaining divergent patterns of organic sector development but solid conclusions are elusive. We suggest that future policy orientated research on organic sector apply existing theories on public policy and carefully design studies in accordance with the prescriptions of the comparative research method. This would enable policy researchers to reach more robust conclusions on policy relevant factors influencing growth of the organic sector than are currently found in the literature.</dc:description>
