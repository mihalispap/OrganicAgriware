  <dc:description>Perennial herbs can be difficult to manage because of their underground storage organs which live sheltered from observation and control. In this paper, we describe the development of a population dynamics model for two perennial weeds, Cirsium arvense and Tussilago farfara. The model is physiologically based and includes plant growth and development,  and mowing as a control option. Model performance was compared with field data from monospecific stands of C. arvense in Denmark and Netherlands and of T. farfara in Denmark. Finally, optimal mowing strategies were explored with the model.</dc:description>
