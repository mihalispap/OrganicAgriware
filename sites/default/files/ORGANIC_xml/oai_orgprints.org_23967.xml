  <dc:description>In the last years Suisse has introduced a fairness strategy to enhance trade relations between organic market partners in supply chains within Switzerland. A code of conduct was elaborated, round table discussions on fairness issues were initiated between market partners and a fairness survey was conducted to evaluate the current level of fairness in trade relations. Results are satisfying but also show future challenges.</dc:description>
