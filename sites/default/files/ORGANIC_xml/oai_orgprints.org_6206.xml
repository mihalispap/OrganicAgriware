  <dc:title>Förderung von Biofrüchten und -Beeren</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Fruit and berries</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Coop, with its  “Naturaplanfonds”, has the intention to promote organic production in Switzerland. Until 2003 sales of organically produced berries were very low. Also table grapes, pome and stone fruit need support and promotion activities along the whole chain from farm to shelf. &#xD;
&#xD;
The aim of the project is to ensure a continuous delivery for Coop with an attractive assortment of organic fruit and berries. A nation-wide professional producers' network and a logistic system should be established. &#xD;
&#xD;
Between 2002 and 2005 the sales of organic berries at Coop rose by 371 %.  Currently, special attention is given to table grapes, stonefruit and pears.</dc:description>
