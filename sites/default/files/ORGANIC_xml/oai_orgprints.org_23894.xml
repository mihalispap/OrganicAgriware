  <dc:description>In the Netherlands networks of goat, cow and poultry farmers started to grow trees in their fields and outdoor runs. This was done for different reasons: animal welfare (shelter); production of fodder, biomass, litter or fruits; spread of minerals from manure; increase biodiversity; keep away certain wild animals that carry diseases. In this abstract we present the project activities and the first experiences from the farmers. The so-called ‘silvopastoral’ systems (= combination of trees and animals) are applied traditionally already long times in Africa and Mediterranean countries. Now we apply them in modern, relatively high input animal husbandry systems.</dc:description>
