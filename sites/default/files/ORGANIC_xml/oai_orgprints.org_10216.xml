  <dc:description>The research is aimed at implementing a methodology in order to estimate the sustainability of an agricultural system, through the use of Agro-ecological and Sustainability Indicators. The methodology is applied to three stockless, experimental agricultural systems, part of a long-term experiment (MOLTE) managed with diverse typologies (old organic, new organic vs conventional). The results derived from the three different management systems are estimated by considering crop rotation and efficiency in terms of energetic, macro-element (N, P, K) and organic matter flow. These are related to the landscape and biodiversity system, as well as the soil and the environmental system. The research shows that the agro-ecosystems managed with the organic agriculture method has succeeded to attain optimal levels of sustainability. Independently of time duration from conversion, the organic systems are better than the conventional system for all indicators, with the exception of the soil indicators that showed remarkable resilience.</dc:description>
