  <dc:description>The development of organic cotton farming in Benin has unveiled the role of women as separate cotton producer, where approximately one third of organic cotton farmers are female (OBEPAB, 2004). This paper compares the profit of organic cotton cultivation by male and female farmers in Benin. Results showed that women increase their part of household income by producing organic cotton even though they make less profit than male farmers. It is suggested, that giving credit to female organic cotton farmers would contribute to increasing their profit and harmonizing the gender relationship in households. The paper also suggests designing a model to advise rural households in the allocation of female labour.</dc:description>
