  <dc:description>A consumer research study of food purchases in 10 households in Juva, Finland, in 2004 suggests that few households are environmentally conscious as was the case in the Järna study. The primary aim of this consumer survey was to see what a typical Finnish food basket might contain (consumption profile). A secondary goal was to find out how many of the items in that basket were locally and ecologically produced foodstuffs.</dc:description>
