  <dc:description>The concept of “Eco-regions” (or “Bioregionen” in German) entered the discussion on rural development in Austria several years ago. Broadly, this expression means the combination of sustainable farming in particular organic farming practices, and the marketing of their produce with  the aim of assisting regional development. As we shall see, this concept can take various forms of expression. It can be restricted to the agricultural sector or extended to a general regional strategy. The common feature is a territorial form of cohesion under the umbrella of organic farming. The very idea comes from two directions: the organic movement on one hand and regional development on the other.</dc:description>
