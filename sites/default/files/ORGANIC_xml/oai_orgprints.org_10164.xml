  <dc:description>The main dietary risk factors associated with the early onset of the non-communicable diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer) would seem to be the over-consumption of dietary lipids and the under-consumption of dietary micronutrients. Consumer preference for lower fat, higher protein diets and for less saturated and more polyunsaturated fat has been around for a number of years. However, more recent clinical studies have indicated benefi cial (anti-infl ammatory) effects of increasing the omega-3: omega- 6 ratio of dietary PUFA and potential anti-cancer and -heart disease effects of increasing consumption of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). These factors are considered in relation to the fatty acid composition of milk and meat derived from organic systems. Animal products are also important sources of several micronutrients and recent information of the health benefi ts of increasing dietary selenium and iron are considered in relation to promoting organic animal products to the health-conscious consumer.</dc:description>
