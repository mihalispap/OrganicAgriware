  <dc:title>The role of innovativeness and quality management in the improvement of competitiveness and performance in animal production enterprises in conventional and organic agriculture</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Policy environments and social economy</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The standardized quality systems are widely maintained in Finnish small and medium sized agro-food enterprises but the effects of quality systems upon business performance and profitability has been little examined. For that reason the study aims to provide an empirical insight into the economical effects of standardized quality systems and into the connections of innovativeness and profitability in small and medium sized enterprises in Finnish agriculture. &#xD;
&#xD;
The results of the study will be usefull particularly for entrepreneurs in their business management and education.</dc:description>
