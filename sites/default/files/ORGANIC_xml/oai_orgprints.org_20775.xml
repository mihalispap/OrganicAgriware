  <dc:description>Emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccum SCHUEBL, is an old variety of cereals which has been traditionally grown in aride&#xD;
areas. Nowdays, it is mainly grown in Italy, Spain, Turkey, Austria and in the Czech republic. This article deals with&#xD;
a study of quality parametres and selected economic parametres of 6 varieties coming from the genetic resources of emmer wheat. High crude protein content in grain was proved during the trials. Nevertheless, such a characteristic is not suitable for the classical bakery processing (production of leavened products). Low figure of the harvest index is supposed to be the most problematic economic character. However, emmer wheat is a suitable variety for organic farming system. Growing of emmer wheat contributes to an extension of the agrobiodiversity in the countryside and to the suistainable development of a region.</dc:description>
