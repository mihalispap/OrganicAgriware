  <dc:description>Over thirty years a significant depletion of P and K in soil occured when the were not given in fertilizers. This caused a reduction in crop yield. An abundant P application exceeding the crop uptake very clearly prevented the yield reduction but did not raise the extractable P concentration in the soil. Severe K deficiency did not start to appear until 20 years of growing cereal without fertilizer K. K application compensating for the uptake by the crop did not prevent the decrease of its extractable concentration in this soil, but this decrease did not affect crop yield.</dc:description>
