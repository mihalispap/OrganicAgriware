  <dc:description>1. Dominant females do not decrease the skatole and androstenone concentration in entire male pigs being dominated during the growth period from 50-100 kg liveweight (see fig. 1 and 3).&#xD;
2. The amount of entire male pigs having higher skatole concentrations in blood – corresponding to skatole in backfat &gt; 0.15 µg/g – are surprisingly high at 50 kg and 75 kg liveweight compared to 100 kg (10, 9 and 13 entire male pigs).&#xD;
3. Furthermore it is not the same pigs having high skatole concentrations during the period from 50 over 75 to 100 kg liveweight.&#xD;
4. The crossbreed HxLYD had significant higher skatole concentration in backfat at slaughter (100 kg liveweight) compared to the crossbreed YDxLYD (P&lt;0.05)(see fig. 2). However, there was no significant difference in androstenone concentration in backfat at&#xD;
100 kg liveweight between the 2 crossbreeds (see fig. 3).</dc:description>
