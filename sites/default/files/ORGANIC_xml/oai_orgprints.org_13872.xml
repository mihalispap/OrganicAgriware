  <dc:description>Several products were tested for their efficacy in control of the apple seed moth (Grapholita lobarzewskii&#xD;
Ragonot). None of them had a good efficacy. With several treatments with Bacillus thuringiensis an efficacy&#xD;
about 50 % could be achieved. An early treatment before egg-laying seem to improve the results. Quassia&#xD;
extract (9 g Quassin/ha/m tree height) gave efficacy about 50-60 % even if treated only once. NeemAzal&#xD;
gave only moderate efficacy (about 40-50 %). Mating disruption method was effective if the populations were&#xD;
not too high when the treatements were started. With high populations there was no sufficient control in the&#xD;
first year of application.</dc:description>
