  <dc:description>Abstract – Secondary plants metabolites – polyphenolic acids - play important role in plant defence system. Polyphenolic acids content determination is used with the aim to discriminate organically and conventionally produced plants. The procedure suitable for determination of twelve polyphenolic acids is described. Applying gradient separation in High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Diode Array Detector for their content estimation suitable baseline separation was achieved. Results of free, glycosidically bound and esterified polyphenolic acids are presented. Model plant products are carrot and winter wheat produced under organic and conventional agricultural system.</dc:description>
