  <dc:description>Fairtrade retail sales increased by 12.1% in the UK while organics sales decreased by 12.9% in 2009. This paper examines the lessons that the organics sector might usefully draw from the successful experiences of the Fairtrade movement. Three lessons of exposition and three lessons of engagement are identified. Fairtrade has a common logo across markets, typically there is a narrative, and the provenance of the ingredients is stated. Fairtrade has successfully extended its branding to engage with places and educational and faith communities, and to publicly acknowledge such engagements. There are 500 Fairtrade Towns in the UK, along with 118 Fairtrade universities, a diversity of faith communities including over 6000 Fairtrade churches, and over 4000 UK schools are registered in the Fairtrade Schools Scheme.</dc:description>
