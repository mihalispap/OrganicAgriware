  <dc:description>Meta-evaluation can be seen as a quality control measure of policies or programs. For that purpose, a formal methodology is used when assessing the quality of an evaluation work. The presented meta-evaluation is based on an adapted version of the evaluation standards used by DEGEVAL (German evaluation society). The well-balanced design of the DEGEVAL standards makes them widely applicable and useful also for conducting meta-evaluations. This paper presents the results of a meta-evaluation undertaken on the evaluation of the German Federal Organic Farming Scheme. Concerning most sections the quality of the underlying study is excellent.</dc:description>
