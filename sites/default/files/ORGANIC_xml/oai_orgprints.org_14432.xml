  <dc:description>From the year 2000 onwards, organic farmers in Eastern Austria have been&#xD;
complaining about damages in arable crops by former inconspicuous or recently&#xD;
immigrated insect pests. In our project, the recent obvious changes in occurrence of&#xD;
arable pests were investigated with respect to climate change. The literature was&#xD;
evaluated focussing on Austria and the adjacent Eastern Middle European countries.&#xD;
Further on, conspicuously, weather-related pest outbreaks in Austria in the last years&#xD;
were documented by interrogating plant protection experts. For a number of species&#xD;
from cereals, root crops, oil-, protein- and fodder crops, in recent years an increasing&#xD;
pest pressure was stated, caused rather by changes in cultivation systems (crop&#xD;
rotation, reduced soil cultivation) than by climate change. Several other pests, mainly&#xD;
from cereals (including maize) showed pest outbreaks from 2000 onwards, with a&#xD;
maximum in the extremely warm and dry year 2003. In a case study, the weather and&#xD;
climate-related background for the distribution and abundance of wheat bugs&#xD;
(Eurygaster sp., Aelia sp.) was investigated. In comparing the “wheat bug years” 1953&#xD;
and 2003, similarities in weather trends were detected which might have caused the&#xD;
bug outbreaks in both years. Concluding, the implementation of a long-term&#xD;
monitoring system for pest occurrence and climate change is recommended aiming at&#xD;
risk avoidance of climate-related pest calamities in the future.</dc:description>
