  <dc:description>Organic farming has been dismissed as unscientific. This perception is often based on a lack of understanding of underlying concepts. The paper reviews the key theoretical bases of the organic approach in scientific terms and discusses the various methodologies used in this area. It argues that a holistic approach to scientific investigations is valid even if, at present, it is more of an aspiration than a reality.</dc:description>
