  <dc:description>This paper describes an evaluation of experiential learning in agroecology, based on analysis of learning outcomes as described by students in their individual Learner (Reflection) Documents. Galt et al. (2013) highlighted the importance of reflective essays in reinforcing experiential learning. Each fall semester since 2000, students in an agroecology course in farming and food systems at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (UMB) have submitted a self-evaluation of their learning as well as the teaching process. Their Learner Document is based on a log the students write about their experiences in the field, including interactions with stakeholders on farms and in communities, and lectures and discussion sessions with students and facilitators in and out of the classroom. Together with practical aspects described in the log is an in-depth reflection by each student on the learning process. While the students work in teams of four to six people to produce a Client (Stakeholder) Document, in cooperation with their stakeholders in the farming and food system, the Learner Document is written individually and reflects their personal learning experience.</dc:description>
