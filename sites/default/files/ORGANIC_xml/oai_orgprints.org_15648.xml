  <dc:title>The iPOPY Young Researchers Workshop on Organic and Healthy Foods in Schools - Methods and Early Results</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>"Organics" in general</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Organic and healthy foods in schools is the focus of the iPOPY project (Innovative Public Organic Procurement for Youth), in the New Nordic food on schools as well as in of a lot of other school focused public health nutrition evaluation and research projects. Common to all is the focus on children and adolescents as informants and “study objects” and the focus on food, nutrition and agency in school. Against this  background we would like to invite for an open discussion of methods and preliminary results for the students and researchers in and close to the project.</dc:description>
