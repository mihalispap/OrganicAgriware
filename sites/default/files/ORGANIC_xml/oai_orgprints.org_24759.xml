  <dc:subject>Pasture and forage crops</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>There is growing interest in establishing highly biodiverse grasslands that are also capable of maintaining high yields. In order to design successful multispecies mixtures it is necessary to know the competitiveness of individual species and how different management regimes affect this. Some species can survive in highly productive pastures,&#xD;
while others need nursing in special mixtures if they are to make a significant contribution to the forage.&#xD;
This is investigated in the ECOSERVE project and has also been studied in the earlier ORGGRASS project.</dc:description>
