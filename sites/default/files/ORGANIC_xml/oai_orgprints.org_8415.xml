  <dc:description>This report was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. The recent Curry Commission report recognised the need to provide incentives for the production of public goods in terms of the environment. This is a particular advantage for organic farming because its biodiversity benefit is no longer being seriously questioned and many, large NGOs have a positive policy attitude towards organic farming. However, to ensure a good deal for organic farming in any new development of agri-environment schemes, the organic sector needs to play a positive role, with careful consideration of all steps in the development of policy.</dc:description>
