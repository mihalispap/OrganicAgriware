  <dc:description>Scab-resistant apple varieties are urgently required in ecological fruit growing in the Lake&#xD;
Constance region. In the season 2007 more than 60 scab-resistant varieties were&#xD;
investigated concerning their sensibility to sooty blotch. Apart the influence of harvest&#xD;
periods (early or late) the investigations show an influence of the cross parents of new&#xD;
varieties. Varieties with Topaz as one parent were much more sensitive to sooty blotch&#xD;
than varieties with Florina as cross partner.</dc:description>
