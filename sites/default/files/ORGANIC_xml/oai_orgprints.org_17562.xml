  <dc:description>The evaluation of food chain environmental impacts was conducted using an environmental&#xD;
accounting model developed for the Finnish food sector, and a model of a Finnish standard lunch plate, which&#xD;
followed nutritional recommendations and represented division of a plate into three parts; half of the plate&#xD;
comprising vegetables, one quarter protein and one quarter carbohydrate.The impacts on climate change were&#xD;
analysed over the whole food chain. Different methods of food processing were assessed: preparation of a&#xD;
standard lunch plate at home, public food service preparation of lunch portions and industrial processing of&#xD;
ready‐made food. The overall aim was to help consumers make environmentally responsible choices in&#xD;
consumption and identify the key areas requiring improvement in terms of climate change and the food supply&#xD;
chain.According to environmental accounting in the food sector, the food chain accounts for 7% of CO2&#xD;
emissions, 43% of CH4 emissions, and 50% of N2O emissions produced across the entire economy. Impact&#xD;
contribution of the Finnish food chain in climate change was calculated to be 14%. Food represented 15‐20% of&#xD;
the climate change impact of daily consumption. The carbon footprint ranged from 570g to 3.5kg equivalent&#xD;
CO2 for a single food portion. Impact profiles of portions varied depending on raw material composition and&#xD;
production procedure. Producers of animal products, food consumers making their food choices, and&#xD;
particularly decision makers in public catering are the critical stakeholders for minimizing climate change&#xD;
impacts of the food chain.</dc:description>
