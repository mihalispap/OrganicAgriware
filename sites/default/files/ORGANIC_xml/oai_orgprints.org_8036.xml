  <dc:description>The organic system is urging the use of organic seeds in order to complete its integrity  and  enhance its reliability. The VIFP Organic Revision offered the possibility to investigate on the different issues related to organic seeds production and use: alternative seed treatments methods; variety availability; derogation regime in several EU Member States and causes for non-use of organic seeds. The results indicate the extreme difficulty the organic vegetable sector will suffer in case it is decided to stop the derogation regime and compell producers to use exclusively organic seeds.</dc:description>
