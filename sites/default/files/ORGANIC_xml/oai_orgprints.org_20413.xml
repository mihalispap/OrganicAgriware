  <dc:description>In view of the interest in analyzing volatile compounds by SPME, the following five microfibers were tested, polydimethylsiloxane; polyacrylate; polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene; carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane, and carbowax/divinylbenzene, to select the one which presents the best performance for the adsorption of the volatile compounds present in the headspace of acid lime juice samples. Sample stabilization time variations (30 and 60 minutes) were assessed as well the addition of NaCl to the samples. It was verified that the chromatogram with the most adsorbed volatile compounds was obtained with PDMS/DVB microfiber at 30 minutes and the addition of 0.2 g NaCl.</dc:description>
