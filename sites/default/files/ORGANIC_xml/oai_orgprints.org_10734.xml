  <dc:description>For further optimisation of organic agricultural systems, more focus is required on&#xD;
organically produced seeds and the development of better adapted varieties.&#xD;
Organic plant breeding and seed production need to comply with the concept of&#xD;
naturalness as applied in organic agriculture, which not only includes the nonchemical&#xD;
and agro-ecological approaches, but also the integrity of life approach.&#xD;
As organic environments are less controllable and are more variable, breeding&#xD;
should aim at improved yield stability and product quality by being adapted to&#xD;
organic soil fertility as well as sustainable weed, pest and disease management.&#xD;
Also the ability to produce economicacceptable seed yield avoiding seed-borne&#xD;
diseases should be included. On the short term, organic plant production can gain&#xD;
better yield stability by increasing within-crop diversity by the use of mixtures of&#xD;
conventionally bred varieties or crop populations. Because of expected genotype&#xD;
by environment interaction more research is needed to define the best selection&#xD;
environment for selecting organic varieties. To arrive at better adapted varieties for&#xD;
organic farming systems the role of practical participatory plant breeding may be&#xD;
crucial.&#xD;
Although organic farming is clear on excluding the use of genetically modified&#xD;
organisms and their derivates, the use of molecular markers is still under debate.&#xD;
Questions arise with respect to their efficiency in selecting the most important&#xD;
organic traits, such as yield stability, and on the compounds and substances to&#xD;
produce and apply them. A major concern for a GM-free organic agriculture is an&#xD;
increasing contamination with genetically modified organisms in organic&#xD;
production and products, i.e., the problems related to co-existence of GM and non-&#xD;
GM agriculture. This paper discusses some important factors with regard to&#xD;
possible impact of co-existence on organic farming. Perspectives to a global scale&#xD;
of organic plant breeding and seed production are given from a European point of&#xD;
view.</dc:description>
