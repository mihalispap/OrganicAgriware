  <dc:description>Field experiments with five rates of annual P fertilisation were carried out at 24 sites in Finland 1977-1994. A summary of the yield results was calculated on the basis of the amounts of P recommended to cereals according to STP in early 1990s.&#xD;
&#xD;
The effects of repeated K fertilisation were studied at 21 sites in 1977-1994.</dc:description>
