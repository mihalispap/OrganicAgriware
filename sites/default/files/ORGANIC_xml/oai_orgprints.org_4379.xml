  <dc:description>The objective of the study is to determine cost-effective interventions that will reach the critical mass of players within the Philippine organic rice value chain, with the requirements of the market as the starting point of the research. To design strategies and programs necessary for the organic rice industry to flourish, the requirements of the target customers were cross-matched against the competencies, capabilities and resources of both the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice) and the existing players. &#xD;
&#xD;
The subsector analysis involved the determination of functions, participants, markets and market channels for the current organic rice produced in the Philippine Archipelago. Benchmarking with progressive and organic produce-exporting countries was done for parallel analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
Based on the results of the preliminary study, systems and structures to ensure the integrity of the organic rice production value chain is of prime importance for the industry to flourish.</dc:description>
