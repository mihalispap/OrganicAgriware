  <dc:description>There have been many research references which have mentioned entry barriers in organic farming. According to previous studies in Korea, it is difficult for majority of small-holders to convert their conventional farming into organic farming due to difficulty in pest and weed control, compost making, marketing organic produces and lower yield and income during the initial 3-4 years. In other words, various types of entry barriers exist when starting organic farming. There is lack of confidence in regulating pests and insects without pesticides as is the case with weed control.</dc:description>
