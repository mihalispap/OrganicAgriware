  <dc:subject>Values, standards and certification</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The growth of organic farming in the European Union and the reasons for supporting organic farming are examined in the context of policy support for organic farming under EC Reg. 2078/92 (the agri-environment programme) and the structural measures (including the development by some countries of integrated action plans combining these measures). The potential for the future expansion of organic farming and the pre-conditions necessary for this to happen are considered in the context of the Agenda 2000 commodity measures and the Rural Development Regulation.</dc:description>
