  <dc:description>The aim of iPOPY is to study how increased consumption of organic food may be achieved by implementation of relevant strategies and instruments linked to food serving outlets for young people in some European countries. Supply chain management, procedures for certification of serving outlets, stakeholders’ perceptions and participation as well as the potential of organic food in relation to health and obesity risks will be analysed.&#xD;
Four countries participate in iPOPY: Denmark, Finland, Italy and Norway. The project is coordinated by Bioforsk, Norway. The Research Council of Norway (RCN) funds the norwegian part and contributions from German researchers. Denmark, Finland and Italy have national fundings.</dc:description>
