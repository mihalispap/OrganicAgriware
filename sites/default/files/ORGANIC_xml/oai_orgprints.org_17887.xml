  <dc:description>This study investigates the N transfer from legumes to  neighbouring plants, grasses, legumes and herbs in a temperate grassland. In a field experiment white clover  (Trifolium repens), red clover (Trifolium pratense) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) were leaf-labelled with 15N enriched urea. The 15N tracer was measured in above-ground plant tissue of eight neighbouring plants in two subsequent harvests in 2008. The three legumes donated 15N to all neighbouring plants, of which grasses, white and red clover were strong receivers. Results show that N transfer increases with N application and from the 1st to the 2nd cut.</dc:description>
