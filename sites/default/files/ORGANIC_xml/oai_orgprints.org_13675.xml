  <dc:description>Mirid bugs are important pests in both integrated and organic fruit production. In a survey&#xD;
in 2006 the proportion of mirids parasitized by parasitoids was investigated in 18&#xD;
Norwegian orchards. More than 50 beating samples were collected from apple and pear&#xD;
orchards under integrated and organic management in different areas of Norway. About&#xD;
30% of nymphs of the most abundant mirid bug species, Lygocoris pabulinus, Ortholylus&#xD;
marginalis and Psallus ambiguus, were parasitized. Important factors for enhancing&#xD;
biological control in organic fruit production are discussed.</dc:description>
