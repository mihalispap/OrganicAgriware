  <dc:description>Although local, short supply chains are regarded as most suitable for organic products, most organic food is sold through general retailers. The extended supply chains create challenges: (1) how to sustain the connection between farmers and consumers and deliver the multifaceted value of organic food and (2) how to cooperate to meet both the needs of consumers and of each independent company involved in the supply chain. This publication gives among other things practical implications concerning organic food supply chains and marketing of organic products.</dc:description>
