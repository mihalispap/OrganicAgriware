  <dc:description>The aim of this study was to compare risk of organic, integrated and conventional cropping systems. Experimental cropping system data (1991-1999) from eastern Norway were combined with farm budget data. Empirical distributions of net farm income for different cropping systems were estimated with a simulation model. The results show that the organic system had the greatest net farm income variability, but both the existing payment system and organic price premiums make it the most economically viable alternative.</dc:description>
