  <dc:description>In autumn 2003; a survey was carried out in six Austrian agricultural high schools in order to obtain an overview of studentsâ€™ attitudes towards organic farming. 25.5% of students from conventional farms have a negative attitude towards organic farming (27.5% hold a neutral attitude, 47% a positive attitude). Significant impacts of land use systems and social norms can be determined. Gender-related differences are highly significant, differences between the schools as well.</dc:description>
