  <dc:description>The present investigatin was undertaken to study the faecal degestibility of dry matter organic matter, protein and fibre for growing pigs fed on high level roughage. The three roughage types studied were clovergrass, clovergrass silage and wholecrop pea-barley silage. The study was conducted in two experimental periods (exp 1 and exp 2). Ineach experiment 10 crossbred female pigs (5 x 2 littermates) were diveded into two groups fed either fresh clovergrass or frozen and thawed clovergrass (exp 1) and either clovergrass silage or wholecrop pea-barley silage (exp 2).</dc:description>
