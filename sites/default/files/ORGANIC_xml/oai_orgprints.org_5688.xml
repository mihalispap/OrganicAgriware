  <dc:title>Interaction between actors in the organic food chain</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Markets and trade</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The aim of the study is to improve the functionality of the organic demand-supply chain and relationships between the actors participating in the chain. The study analyzes how the organic food demand-supply chain functions and, more specifically, how different actors in the organic demand-supply chain cooperate and relate to each other. The focus of the study is, on the one hand, on the actors' attitudes towards organic food and, on the other hand, on information flows in organic supply-demand chains. Quantitative analyzes of the study are based on the Finfood panel data (1998-2004) gathered on producers', food manufacturers', retailers', catering units', and consumers' attitudes towards organic production and products. In addition, two organic demand-supply are considered in more detail by adapting a case study approach.</dc:description>
