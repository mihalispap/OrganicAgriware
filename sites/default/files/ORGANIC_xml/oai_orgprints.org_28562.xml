  <dc:description>The development of local food systems as well as the growing consumer demand for locally produced food is becoming increasingly important for producers, retailers, and politicians alike. The question arises on how consumers decide, when they have to choose between local &amp; non-organic, local &amp; organic, and non-local &amp; organic products. Do local and organic food products compete against each other? Or do they complement one another? Information on consumer preferences and their willingness-to-pay is very important, as it helps to improve food marketing, communication, and policy making. Hence, it would be valuable to discuss results of current consumer research and practical experiences with practitioners, experts, and other interested parties at the Biofach congress.</dc:description>
