  <dc:description>Horse beans are used as an example of grain, which have  potentials to substitute fish meal in fish feed. After several grinding and fractionation steps it was possible to obtain a protein-rich horse bean fraction with a yield of 19 %. This fraction contained 55.9 %  protein. The high protein content together with the amino acid profile makes the fraction very suitable as a substitute to fish meal in fish feed. The protein-rich fraction was used as a successful additive in extruded fish pellets.</dc:description>
