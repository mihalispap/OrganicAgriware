  <dc:description>Organic farming is not generally more endangered by the risk of contamination of the products with mycotoxins than other farming systems. Knowledge about the influence of litter beddings on mycotoxin exposure of livestock is rare. Due to restrictions on silage additives and fungicides, organic farms are limited in their possibilities to prevent and to cure fungal diseases. But the organic production system offers several important factors for lowering infections with mycotoxin producing fungi.</dc:description>
