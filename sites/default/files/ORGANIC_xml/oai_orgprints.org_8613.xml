  <dc:description>This Research Note concludes that both drum drying and ordinary continuous drying efficiently dry the grain but that drum drying is much more efficient in reducing the number of surface dwelling fungal propagules on the grain, both yeasts and filamentous fungi. This includes the toxigenic species, Fusarium culmorum, as well as other fusaria. It also includes the dark filamentous fungi, Alternaria infectoria and Cladosporium spp. Both drying techniques seemed to stimulate growth of Eurotium spp., probably due to heat activation of ascospore germination.</dc:description>
