  <dc:description>Farming systems applying reduced tillage measures are expected to be beneficial for sustaining important soil functions (ecosystem services) and (soil)biodiversity. Furthermore a reduction in tillage intensity is connected to reduced need for energy and labour input. On the other hand waiving the plough is, especially in organic farming systems, suspected to lead to increased weed pressure and therefore decreases in yields. In this paper first results of a study on temporarily reduced tillage in organic crop-rotations are presented. Here the plough was set aside before drilling triticale at the end of four crop rotations, and expectable yields, earthworm biomass and weed pressure were investigated. First one-year-results, of the experiment on temporarily reduced tillage to triticale at the end of organic crop-rotations did not show consistent yield effects. Increase in weed dominance at harvest on sites without ploughing and the expected positive effect on earthworm biomass in spring could not be statistically secured.</dc:description>
