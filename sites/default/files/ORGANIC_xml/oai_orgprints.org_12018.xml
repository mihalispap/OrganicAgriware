  <dc:description>The aim of this study was to collect information about experiences of veterinarians with acupuncture. 27 German veterinarians who regularly used acupuncture on farm animals were interviewed. Most vets had received special training in acupuncture. This treatment method was most often used on horses, followed by cattle (mainly dairy cows). It was especially applied against common diseases which could easily be cured. Treatment costs were higher for horses than for cattle. There has been an increased demand for acupuncture mainly for horses.</dc:description>
