  <dc:description>Presently the value of the organic food market in Germany is approximately 5.8 billion Euros and is growing, but this growth is not reflected in the number of organic farmers. In order to raise the number of organic farmers, organic extension plays an important role. The extension system of organic farming is partly linked to the conventional system; for example organic extensionists are employed by the Chamber of Agriculture. In addition to this, a separate organic extension system exists, organized by the organic farm associations. The key questions of the study are: how to reach conventional apprentices and farmers from the organic-extension point of view, and how to enhance their decision-making authority in terms of conversion. The overall goal is that apprentices and farmers feel competent in their ability to make a decision: conversion, yes or no. Based on empirical data, we have formulated different types of conventional apprentices and farmers, all of whom need different types of information. Consequently, there is not a single approach to optimize initial contact. The intervention mechanisms for organic extension have to be diverse.</dc:description>
