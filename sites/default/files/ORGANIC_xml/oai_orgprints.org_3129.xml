  <dc:description>In addition to the production of grains rich in protein, grain legumes provide several ‘ecological services’ well suited to the development of sustainable agro-ecosystems. Among these services, N entry to the system via biological N2 fixation and soil fertility building have received most of the attention. However in a system perspective attention should also be paid to others services such as break-crop effect, erosion protection, increasing biodiversity. It is discussed how intercropping can be seen as a cropping strategy worth considering to fullfill the demands mentioned above.</dc:description>
