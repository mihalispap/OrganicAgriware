  <dc:description>The first Danish organic rainbow trout with the Danish red Ø label was introduced to the market in 2005. The demand for organic trout is increasing and Danish trout farmers are currently con¬verting to organic production. However, the development of organic trout production in Denmark has been challenged by a very strict national legislation for organic aquaculture production.&#xD;
The objectives of the research include the most critical areas in the chain that forms the link between organic feed production, organic fish rearing, and the consumer. The main focus is on organic fish feeds in which non-renewable fishmeal is partially replaced by sustainable organic vegetable proteins.</dc:description>
