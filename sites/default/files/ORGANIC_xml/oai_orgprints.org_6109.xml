  <dc:description>State of the Art:&#xD;
Since the beginning of the new millennium the sector of research on organic vegetable production has grown rapidly. An improved new kind of coordination is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Definition of the problem:&#xD;
-The scientists working on organic vegetables are only partly networked.&#xD;
-There are no basic guidelines for trials on organic vegetables.&#xD;
-The results of trials which were already carried out are difficult to find. &#xD;
-The transfer of information between scientists, advisors and growers is suboptimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
Project aims:&#xD;
The aim of the project is the development of an independent network covering two fields of activity:&#xD;
-Higher degree of communication transparency between scientists, advisors and growers by widespread collection of important research topics on the one hand and efficient editing of results on the other hand. &#xD;
-Efficiency increase of both personal capacity and research acreage by better coordination of research activities. &#xD;
&#xD;
Methodology:&#xD;
The project is divided into five project parts:&#xD;
-Increase of networking between growers, advisors and scientists both in the federal states and nationwide.&#xD;
-Organisation of workshops aimed at better coordination of research on organic vegetables with participants from practise, advisory services and research.&#xD;
-Development of guidelines to standardise research on organic vegetables.&#xD;
-Drawing of a survey on completed and running trials referring to organic vegetable production. &#xD;
-Permanent editing of up-to-date results for growers and advisors by use of established channels of information (print, internet) to guarantee a broad transfer of knowledge.&#xD;
Results, conclusion, state of the art:&#xD;
After a start-up phase of three years the network shall be able to go into business for itself by funds from federal states and grower's associations.&#xD;
