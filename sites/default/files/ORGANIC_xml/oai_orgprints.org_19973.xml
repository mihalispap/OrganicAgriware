  <dc:description>Milk is as ancient as mankind itself, as it is created to feed the mammalian infant. All species of mammals, from man to whales, produce milk for this purpose. The role of milk in nature is to nourish and provide immunological protection for the mammalian young and it has high nutritional value. Milk that was used in consumer test was treated in a way that nutritional value would remain. The main goal was to see how consumer perceive different milk. The role of milk in the traditional diet has varied remarkably in different regions of the world. The tropical countries have not been traditional milk consumers, whereas the more northern regions of the world. Europe (especially Scandinavia) and North America, have traditionally consumed far more milk and milk products in their diet.</dc:description>
