  <dc:description>Runoff phosphorus (P) associated with eroded soil contributes to eutrophication to some extent. The present work examines two methods for estimating the potential bioavailability of particulate P (PP) in runoff, and studies the concentrations and losses of different P forms in surface and subsurface runoff from arable soils. The potential bioavailability of PP was approximated by extraction with (i) anion exchange resin (AER-PP), giving a measure of desorbable PP under aerobic conditions, and with (ii) bicarbonate-dithionite (BD-PP), which dissolves redox-labile PP. Both methods were applied in runoff analysis without sediment preconcentration.</dc:description>
