  <dc:title>The Differentiation Process in Organic Agriculture (OA) – between Capitalistic Market System and IFOAM Principles</dc:title>

  <dc:description>The organic food chain is in a differentiation process, in between of external (society and conventional agriculture) and internal driving forces (IFOAM principles). Seven external tension fields were identified, which affected the differentiation process. One of the most important internal driving forces was the development out of the four IFOAM principles. It is recommended to address all stakeholders in the organic movement and to identify possibilities for transferring aspects of the IFOAM principles into standards/ guidelines. Furthermore, it is necessary to intensify the network with key societal players.</dc:description>
