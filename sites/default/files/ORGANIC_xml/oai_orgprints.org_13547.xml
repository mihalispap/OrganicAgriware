  <dc:description>Grass clover leys form the basis of most organic farming systems yet the selection of seed mixtures is often founded on tradition or cost. Based on a review of recent and past research this review provides a wealth of information on grass and legume species and varieties, mixture selection, ley establishment and pasture management.&#xD;
The objective of the Grass Clover Ley research review are: &#xD;
1. To identify all the relevant research undertaken&#xD;
2. Collate the results of the research&#xD;
3. Draw on farm and commercial experience&#xD;
4. Summarise the practical implications of the research for organic farming&#xD;
5. Facilitate access to the results of research to advisers in a form which allows easy transfer to farmers. The report presents key conclusions about the choice of legume and gras species and varietes, the management of swards and their role for fertility building.</dc:description>
