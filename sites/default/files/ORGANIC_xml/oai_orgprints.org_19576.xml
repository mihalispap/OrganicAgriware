  <dc:description>Compaction occasionally increased N2O in soil air.&#xD;
No large differences in soil air composition, N2O emissions or moisture content were found between the treatments.&#xD;
The N2O concentrations at 15, 30, 50 and 70 cm depths correlated positively with the emission of N2O from the soil in both fields (r=0.4-0.7***).&#xD;
The subsoil O2 concentrations correlated negatively with N2O emission, but only at the Finnish site.&#xD;
The results suggest that subsoil compaction does not significantly increase N2O emissions from these soils 15-30 years after compaction. This may indicate a minor role of subsoil in the production of N2O compared with topsoil.</dc:description>
