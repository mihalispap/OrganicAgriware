  <dc:description>This paper explores the factors of success for Organic Marketing Initiatives in Europe. It is based upon the results of the OMIaRD project, which aimed to assess the impact of the Organic Marketing Initiatives on Rural Development . The results show that many studied OMIs meet strategic problems linked to their ability to face an increasing of collected, processed and marketed volumes. Those problems can be considered as a strategic turn point and might lead them to perceive the necessity to better manage their growth.</dc:description>
