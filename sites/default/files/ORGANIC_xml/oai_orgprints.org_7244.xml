  <dc:description>Lengths of organic supply chains have been increased by the emergence of intermediaries between consumers and organic farmers. The involvement of supermarkets forces the organic chain to merge into the conventional food chain. The small segment of organic products and consumers creates a challenge for the performance of the organic chain. The case-studies described here were conducted to learn more about the performance of the chain. For this purpose, actors along the chain (from farmers to consumers) were interviewed. Three dimensions affecting performance were found, as well as three different levels of commitment to organics.</dc:description>
