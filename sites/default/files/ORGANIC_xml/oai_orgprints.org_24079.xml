  <dc:description>Varroatosis, as the current bane of the beekeepers, is causing the greatest economic damage in the apicultural sector. Varroa mites have a vector role, distributing viruses and weakening bees that then become more susceptible to other pathogens as well. Disorientation of bees, robbing, and frame exchanging can transport mites from one colony to another (Oliver, 2011). It is generally accepted that there are no colonies without mites in Hungary. Infection levels increase over time in colonies that are left untreated or not managed regularly. The infection level must be kept as low as possible for a sustainable production. Consistent control of varroatosis should be provided without harmful effects such as toxic residues persist in the hive products (honey, wax, etc.). Organic beekeeping methods only allow the use of natural materials such as essential oils and organic acids for managing hive hygiene. In 2013 within the on-farm beekeeping research program, the Hungarian Research Institute for Organic Agriculture (ÖMKi) is collaborating with beekeepers throughout Hungary in comparative trials that test the efficacy of different Varroa control treatments and management methods. These trials are set up in market operations. One essential objective of the program is to monitor Varroa infection levels systematically with different mite-counting techniques. Throughout the season, different treatments and managements are chosen that match with a colonies’ biological state and environmental conditions such as brood period, temperature, etc. Most of the treatments affect only the phoretic mites. Therefore during the season some operations - where it is possible - generate a capped broodless state for treatments. The major part of effective mite control is good timing of the closing treatment in the end of the beekeeping season in the broodless period.</dc:description>
