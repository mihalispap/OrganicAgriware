  <dc:description>The outdoor multi-sire mating system complies with the organic ideal of allowing animals to conduct their natural behaviour. Due to large differences in mating qualities between the teams of boars, the preliminary results of this study indicate that the system, as practiced today, is characterised by unacceptable varying reproduction results. The poor mating quality was related mainly to competition between boars, sows not able to support the weight of the boars and poor mating dexterity of some boars. To improve the system, these parameters much be taken into consideration</dc:description>
