  <dc:description>In 2012, the organic market continued to grow in the European Union, even though some countries were still affected by the economic crisis, leading to stagnation or even decline. According to data provided by the EU-funded project OrganicDataNetwork(www.organicdatanetwork.net), the organic market in Europe increased by approximately 6 percent in 2012. It now amounts to approximately 22.8 billion euros (European Union: 20.9 billion euros).
