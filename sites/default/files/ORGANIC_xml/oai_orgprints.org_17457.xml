  <dc:description>Several European countries have public goals for increased organic production and consumption. The CORE-organic project iPOPY combines studies of drivers and constraints for public organic food procurement with studies of best practice cases. Four work packages study policies for increased organic consumption, supply chain management and certification issues, consumersâ€™ preferences, and actual health-related eating habits. This presentation covers  School Food Provision Systems in Germany.</dc:description>
