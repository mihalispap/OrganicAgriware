  <dc:description>The market of organic products is developing all over the world at all levels. In Europe, America and Asia the rate of development has been impressive for years. Considerable efforts have been made in many countries with a relatively new or emerging organic sector to establish organic products on the market. In relation to this the export is not the only target for these activities – the local, regional and national opportunities are interesting and well understood alternatives.&#xD;
This Manual is aimed at organic food producers, processors and sellers to facilitate their activity. It contains existing data about the development of organic agriculture around the world, in Europe and in Bulgaria. Its aim is to provide information about the preferences of Bulgarian consumers, the level of knowledge of the nature of organic foods and the reasons for purchasing them from the venues they could buy them.&#xD;
	The book can be used in the activity of government institutions, sectoral and non-governmental organisations, consumers’ organisations and by all involved in the problems of organic production.&#xD;
	The manual is based on the results of a survey conducted among Bulgarian consumers by a team of lecturers and researchers at the University for National and World Economy – Sofia in the field of organic agriculture in the country.&#xD;
