  <dc:description>In organic farming the copper compounds are the only substances that can be used against&#xD;
downy mildew. As the copper causes problems of environmental impact, the Regulation EC&#xD;
n. 473/2002 fixed a ceiling on its use. Two-years experimental trials (2007-2008) were&#xD;
carried out in organic vineyard in order to evaluate anti-downy mildew effectiveness of&#xD;
natural products. Homeopathic products, resistance promoters, plant extracts and potassium&#xD;
bicarbonate have been tested. In 2007, a year of limited infection pressure, these products&#xD;
were able to control the disease, whereas in 2008, a year of high risk of disease, the natural&#xD;
products were scarsely effective. In conclusion, the natural products can be used in&#xD;
alternative to copper in condition of low or medium risk of infection, while, in conditions of&#xD;
high infection pressure, it is possible to use the natural products in combination with copper&#xD;
just to reduce the copper input</dc:description>
