  <dc:description>Survey data from a random sample of US food shoppers is analyzed to identify significant factors in organic food demand. Qualitative data is also collected to explore motivations, perceptions and knowledge of both organic and conventional food shoppers. Results indicate that shopping venue, food knowledge, and food beliefs are key to organic food demand. Qualitative investigations indicate some scepticism towards organic labels by both organic and conventional shoppers. Not all organic shoppers viewed the increasing availability of organic foods through conventional venues and brands positively. These shoppers perceive commercialization to run counter to creating a local food system. In addition, perceptions of organic food shoppers were diverse, often conflicting, and sometimes quite negative.</dc:description>
