  <dc:description>Public concern about food quality has intensified in recent years. In the last decades, the amount of farmland managed under certified organic practices has expanded dramatically and it is expected to increase in the future. There is a growing demand for organic foods driven primarily by consumersâ€™ perceptions of the quality and safety of these foods and to the positive environmental impact of organic agriculture practices. This growth in demand is expected to continue in the future. Obviously many factors in production systems have an impact on the health and welfare of the animals involved. Animals feed or forage may be the source of disorders for farm animals also could lead to human illness. The types of feeds administered do not differ significantly in organic farming and in this respect there are mostly quantitative differences observed. Pesticides, agricultural and industrial chemicals, heavy metals, radionuclides as well as natural pollutants as mycotoxins may pollute animal feed. The aim of this review was to find out the possible natural toxins of animals associated with organic farming.</dc:description>
