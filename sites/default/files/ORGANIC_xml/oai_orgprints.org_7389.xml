  <dc:title>Development of organic farming in distant rural Maori communities in New Zealand</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>Kerckhoffs, Dr LHJ (Huub)</dc:creator>
  <dc:description>Abstract - A unique programme was initiated between scientists and distant rural Māori communities in New Zealand’s East Coast to help these communities with the transition from extensive agriculture to intensive organic horticulture. Through intensive collaboration  and interaction with local organic Māori growers (organised within a growers’ trust), scientific, educa-tional and extension services have been provided to develop and implement best organic vegetable grow-ing practices. Initial topics were soil (fertility) and weed management, and these were illustrated in a range of workshops, fieldwalks and fieldtrials.</dc:description>
