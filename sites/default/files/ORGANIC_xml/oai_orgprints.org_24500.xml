  <dc:description>Nine categories of organic versus non-organic products were scored for taste on a scale of 1 to 5. The organic products were from the Duchy Originals range produced by Prince Charlesâ€™s organic food company and sold at Waitrose, a UK supermarket chain. The comparable alternatives were sourced from Tesco, Sainsbury, Morrisons, Marks &amp; Spencer, ASDA, Lidl, and Aldi. In these taste tests conducted by UK journalist/chef Anne Shooter the organic products lead in seven of the nine product categories, scoring 5/5 for each of sliced ham, strawberry jam, shortbread, Earl Grey tea, oatcake biscuits, Stilton cheese, and pate. For taste, the Organic products scored a total of 42 out of a possible 45, the Premium products scored 32/45, while the Budget range scored 25/45.</dc:description>
