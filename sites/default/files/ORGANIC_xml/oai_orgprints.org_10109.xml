  <dc:description>In a questionnaire send out in the mid 90â€™ties, organic growers estimated a yield reduction of at least 86 per cent compared to conventional production. The estimation was based on production of the most common conventional grown varieties. The main reason for this low productivity is lack of control methods against diseases and pests, especially apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) (Lindhard et al., 1998). In Denmark, most organic pesticides are not registered. For instance, copper has not been on the market for 7 years.</dc:description>
