  <dc:description>In this working paper it is the intention to outline the evolution of organic agriculture in Denmark. The paper do not claim to be a total presentation of the history but is aiming to present important milestones, actors involved, intentions and reflections of the actors, and especially to illustrate interaction between the sector labelled as “organic agriculture” and the social surroundings. Based on the findings of the OASE-project a cut off of epoches is used to structure the presentation: Grassroot pioneering, rallying by means of separation (the more excluded an focus narrowed to farming), inclusion (organic agriculture certified by government etc.), absorption (organic farming as an integrated part of established agri systems) while the present epoche is suggested as Funky Business.</dc:description>
