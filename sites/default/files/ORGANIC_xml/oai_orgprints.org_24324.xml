  <dc:description>Joining with AOI and the Benefits. In 2008 Brenjonk started to widen its network to be able to reach its vision. Becoming the member of AOI was a fitting step for Brenjonk in widening its network, because of the aligned vision and missions of the two organizations. Since joining AOI, Brenjonk has improved its knowledge base on how to correctly implement organic quality assurance system. Brenjonk started to develop its ICS governance and perform trial and error to its organic quality assurance system. From then on, Brenjonk gained valuable experience, ranging from process documentation, internal inspection, making decision based on the inspection result, and also reacting to external challenges that often dishearten Brenjonk community members.</dc:description>
