  <dc:description>This research indicates that it is possible for farmers to convert from an intensive conventional system (Punjab) to organic farming, or to make a living on a smallholding in difficult terrain (Uttarakhand). Both alternatives can provide a good livelihood with sustainable methods. I also found that the organizations that assist the farmers in this transition are crucial, because they teach the farmers new methods and give practical and moral support during a time when they feel uncertain making such a large change in how they make their living. One of them is Navdanya, which has been working in Uttarakhand and in several other states in India for nearly three decades. The organization trains and supports farmers converting to organic practices and helps to improve the farming methods of those farmers who have been using traditional, natural methods all along. While a reduction in crop yield, especially during the conversion period, is seen in intensive production systems such as those in Punjab, traditional, low-input production systems as in Uttarakhand often see an immediate increase in the yields after converting to organic methods. This is because in organic agriculture, the farmers make use of a number of on-farm fertility sources including vermi compost, crop residue, and animal manure. Multi-cropping is also used to increase production on small plots and to reduce the risk of loss where there is drought or other difficult climatic conditions.</dc:description>
