  <dc:description>Synthetic crop protection agents play an essential role in the protection of plants or harvested fruits against microorganisms. They are effective and economically advantageous but, by modern standards, they lack selectivity and applied at high rates they are threat to human health and environment. Complying with the growing public awareness of these hazards, increasing emphasis is placed upon the search for novel, natural products with pesticidal activity. Phenolic compounds, present in the olive fruit, definitely belong to this group.</dc:description>
