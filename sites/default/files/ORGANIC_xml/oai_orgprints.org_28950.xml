  <dc:description>Red clover is a perennial legume considered productive for a limited number of years. This experiment quantified the impacts of cultivar, companion grass, harvest schedule and nitrogen fertiliser on crop yield in the third year after reseeding, and compared these to grass receiving inorganic N fertiliser. &#xD;
Herbage yield was increased in swards with red clover by including ryegrass in the seed mix, by not applying inorganic N fertiliser in mid-March and by adopting the early harvest schedule. Red clover cultivar did not affect annual yield.</dc:description>
