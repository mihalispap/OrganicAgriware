  <dc:description>The project ’Productivity and Growth in Organic Value Chain (ProGrOV)’ is a combined research, development and capacity building project that focuses on different aspects of organic value chains in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. It is addressing the need for sustainable development of smallholder farming systems in East Africa with focus on value chains for local high-value markets as well as export chains through PhD and MSc projects at universities in the three countries. While some research has focused on improving productivity and Natural Resource Management of smallholder farmers in Eastern Africa this has most often not been linked with studies of how to link improved production to market access and quality demands. The project is developing a value chains approach with emphasis on information flow between researchers and stakeholders with the students acting as intermediaries compiling and translating information as part of their research projects. Feed-back information between researchers and stakeholders is, however, often not taking place in a systematically form and can be difficult to conceptualise. Initial finding are also indicating that it is a challenge to find a balance between participatory approach in MSc and PhD research projects and the academic requirements of universities.</dc:description>
