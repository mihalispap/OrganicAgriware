  <dc:description>Based on the political legitimacy for healthy food and environment by the citizens, the traditional public catering is suggested to be conceptualised as a public catering system. This Luhmann inspired systems notion conveys the boundary between the catering system and its environments, stressing the environmental communication and adaptation by catering systems. However, environmental communication needs more developed and particular environmental constructions to be implemented on the level of particular catering systems. Organisational and communication research on the shop floor is needed in order to solve particular tensions. The systems approach to catering discloses how profound a change is at hand when actors simply try to connect the aspects of health and environment to public catering.</dc:description>
