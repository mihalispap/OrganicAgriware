  <dc:description>The first benchmark study of Lepidoptera at Sheepdrove Organic Farm employed the nationally-recognised standard transect walking method as used by the organisation ‘Butterfly Conservation.’ A transect through a variety of habitat was selected. The sample of the butterfly species at Sheepdrove showed a good range of common species, including types typical of alkaline grassland. There were definite zones of higher density, linked with habitat type. In these zones, there was better variety of species and better counts of butterflies. Overall, sampling reflects the need to give high priority to conservation efforts for the habitat that supports the most butterflies, however the occurrence of adults does not always indicate the habitat needs of the caterpillars.</dc:description>
