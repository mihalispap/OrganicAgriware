  <dc:description>The NDICEA model was used to simulate and evaluate field trials, designed to improve organic cropping system by using reduced tillage and green manures. The model can help to assess whether nitrogen shortages are likely to occur, and to evaluate the effect of green manure and reduced tillage conditions on nitrogen dynamics and soil organic matter pools.&#xD;
To investigate the effects of tillage and nutrient management on N cycling and soil organic matter pools using the model NDICEA for different experimental sites across Europe. In addition adaptations to the NDICEA model are proposed to cover the effects of reduced tillage in these computer simulations.</dc:description>
