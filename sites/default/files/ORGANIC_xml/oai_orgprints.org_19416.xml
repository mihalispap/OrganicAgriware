  <dc:description>Grain quality of wheat is one of the major concerns of organic farming production. Cereal-legume intercropping may be of significance in this regard as it enhances the yield productivity and the grain protein content (GPC) of the intercropped wheat. However, fitted tools are needed for the diagnosis and management of such interspecific canopies. Our main objectives were i) to analyse the effect of intercropping and N-management on organic farming performances and ii) to analyse the relationships between N-status indicators and GPC of intercropped wheat. These objectives were assessed in winter pea–wheat intercrops in 2007 and 2009 in western France. Our study confirmed the significance of intercropping in the production of wheat with high GPC. We showed that tools for diagnosis, fitted for sole crops to manage grain yield and GPC (N nutrition index, chlorophyll meter), can be used on intercropped wheat.</dc:description>
