  <dc:description>Experts on organic food marketing and rural development from a variety of occupational backgrounds in 18 European countries were sent three subsequent questionnaires including feedback on the results of the previous round in this Delphi inquiry into the market for organic food and impact for rural development in Europe. The response to all three rounds has been good (response rate of 51% between the 1st and 3rd round).  In broad terms the response of 129 experts to the third confirmed the tentative conclusions of the second round and provided some additional insights.</dc:description>
