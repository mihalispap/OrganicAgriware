  <dc:description>It was the aim of this meeting to train the assessors of several CoreOrganic-Partners (i.e. Austria, Germany, Denmark and Norway) with regard to the methods which are going to be applied in the course of the project on-farm assessments. Training involved animal-based parameters, a resource checklist and a management questionnaire.&#xD;
After a theoretical and practical introduction, inter-observer reliability (IOR) of the main animal-based parameters was tested. This included gait scoring/lameness, body condition, cleanliness and integument alterations. The scoring systems for gait scoring, cleanliness and integument alterations had been adapted from the WelfareQualityÂ® protocol; body condition was scored according to Metzner et al. (1993).&#xD;
Subjective scoring systems which are used in many epidemiological studies have the advantage that they do not require any equipment but - due to the subjectivity of the assessment - it is necessary to achieve acceptable inter-observer reliability (IOR) before and after the study to ensure valid data.</dc:description>
