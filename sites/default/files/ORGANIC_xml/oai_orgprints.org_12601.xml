  <dc:description>The study was conducted as a part of a EU-wide survey on organic supply chains, carried on in 8 European Countries. In this paper we report the results of the study regarding the winter wheat supply chain in Italy, France and Hungary. In depth interviews with key-informants were carried on in 2006 to investigate the relationships within the supply chain. Results show a low level of collaboration among various actors especially on cost and benefits sharing.</dc:description>
