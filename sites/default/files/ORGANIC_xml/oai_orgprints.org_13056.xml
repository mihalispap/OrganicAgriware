  <dc:description>Fly prevention and control on animal production units is necessary to prevent the transmission of pathogens that could affect animal and human health and the maintenance of good hygiene. Organic farmers are often hesitant to apply insecticides for this purpose because of their farming philosophy. Organic production systems are relatively open as pigs generally have access to the outdoors. Here, we investigate the need for fly control and analyse various possibilities that organic farmers have to reduce the number of flies on their farms. We conclude that although biological control looks promising, more research should be done concerning its side effects. Currently, optimal monitoring and prevention seem to offer the best solution.</dc:description>
