  <dc:description>In 2010, the Republic Act 10068 or Organic Agriculture Act (OAA) was signed to promote and further develop the practice of organic agriculture in the Philippines. The Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM) as one of the implementing agencies of the OAA and National Organic Agriculture Program (NOAP) has a critical role in implementing programs and projects that would provide support services to improve the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of soil and conduct research and development studies on this concern. &#xD;
&#xD;
Recognizing that there is a need to study the different soil management practices in third party certified organic farms, which have received the national award as outstanding organic farm from 20011-2013, the BSWM documented the best practices on soil fertility management of the three (3) farms and the changes in soil properties over time to evaluate the effects of organic farming on soil quality using the modified WOCAT questionnaire as documentation instrument.</dc:description>
