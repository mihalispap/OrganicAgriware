  <dc:description>Produce fermented organic sausages and herbal, fermentation extracts with enhanced microbial safety.&#xD;
1. Document the quality and microbial safety of organic fermented sausages and perform analyses of production processes with regard to microbial risks. &#xD;
2. Develop protocols for producing extracts of organically grown herbs with enhanced microbial safety based on fermentation. Focus will be on optimisation of sensory properties and enhanced microbial safety. &#xD;
3. Identify, select and test key process operations and parameters to improve the microbial safety of organic fermented sausages. &#xD;
4. Document the microbial quality and survival of pathogenic bacteria in i) extracts of fermented and fresh herbs, and ii) fermented sausages produced by “new” recipe / process. &#xD;
5. Evaluate sensory properties of herbal extracts and organically produced fermented sausage applying herbal ingredients and key strategies/parameters for high quality products with enhanced microbial safety. &#xD;
6. Disseminate obtained knowledge between participants in the project, and to stakeholders throughout the organic food chain.</dc:description>
