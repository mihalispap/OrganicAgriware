  <dc:description>The aim of HEALTHYGROWTH is to build knowledge that can be useful for the development of new organic value chains and new opportunities for organic producers. There is a major variation in how developed organic markets are in the different European countries involved in the HEALTHYGROWTH project. They all do however, all share challenges and interest in building knowledge on how segments of organic value-chains can grow out of the small-scale food segment without losing its ecological values. The HEALTHYGROWTH teams examined research of a number of successful medium-scale values based food chains in order to learn about how these chains are able to combine volume and values, and to use this knowledge to support the development of the organic market. The aim of this review is to develop a sound knowledge base for empirical case studies for the Healthygrowth project.&#xD;
&#xD;
The review of the state of the art in the participating countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Lithuania, Slovenia, Turkey, Germany, France, Austria and Norway), identified the following common features within the of supply chains. &#xD;
• They emphasize the diversity of values and product qualities far beyond organic standards (eg rationality, animal welfare, fair pricing). &#xD;
• Most chains have access to a variety of sales channels, in many cases, both direct and indirect channels. &#xD;
• They use a variety of methods to communicate the values and qualities of products to customers and consumers. &#xD;
• They emphasize personal relationships between players in order to build trust and shared values along the chain to ensure communication of product qualities. Values related to the business relationship are also emphasized. &#xD;
• They have established a diversity of organizational forms / structures, where different forms of producer organizations is common. &#xD;
&#xD;
These are characteristics of successful value chains and they seem to be closely associated with each other to achieve healthy growth.</dc:description>
