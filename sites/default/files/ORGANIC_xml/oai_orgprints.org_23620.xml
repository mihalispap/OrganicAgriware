  <dc:description>Organic agriculture is a holistic production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity. On the other hand, nanotechnology is a rapidly developing domain of research and practice, the terminology is in a state of flux and usage is evolving. Nano-applications are being applied across the entire agriculture and food sectors. In agriculture, for example, nano-pesticides and nano-sensors are changing the nature of agricultural production. In regard to use of nanotechnologies in organic production currently, there are no national or international regulation, definitions, licensing or declaration requirements. We are still a long way off from conclusively assessing nanotechnologies or individual substances with nanoparticles, since we do not yet have the toxiclogical and ecological bases to do this. In our view, all of nanotechnology applications should be evaluated case by case. Positive or negative lists seem to be a good tool to regulate the use of nanotechnology in organic agriculture.</dc:description>
