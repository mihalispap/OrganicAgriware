  <dc:description>Novel antagonists for biological control of Venturia inaequalis causing apples scab were screened. Several hundred fungal isolates were obtained from sporulating colonies of V. inaequalis on apple leaves collected at various locations. Candidate antagonists were pre-screened to exclude those isolates with potential risks or low economical feasibility. Remaining isolates were tested on apple seedlings for their ability to reduce conidiation of V. inaequalis. Several promising antagonists could be selected and will be tested under field conditions in summer 2006.</dc:description>
