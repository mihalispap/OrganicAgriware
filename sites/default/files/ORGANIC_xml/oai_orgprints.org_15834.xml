  <dc:description>Manufacturing and also maintenance and repair energy demand is hard to find, there are only few research data available and this data seems no to be very reliable. Manufacturing energy damand can be calculated by estimating the mean tractor usage and calculating the manufacturing energy per consumed fuel liter. In this way it is easy to estimate the manufacturing energy, because it can be calculated with the liter/ha figures. Fuel consumption for different works in the form of liter/ha can easily  be found in literature.</dc:description>
