  <dc:description>The effects of a fogging system on the control of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) were studied in greenhouse cultivation of eggplant, cucumber and strawberry during the period 1999-2006. At the beginning the pest and the phytoseiid predator Phytoseiulus persimilis were released on the crops and then observations were made on the development of the populations of both mites. Fogging system effects were found in terms of lowering the T. urticae population and hindering the growth of powdery mildew fungus. Furthermore there was a yield increase in the cases of strawberry and cucumber in 2001 but no negative impact on pest management was ever detected, particularly on the biological control of the melon aphid (Aphis gossypii) achieved using multiple releases of parasitoids.</dc:description>
