  <dc:description>Paul Rye Kledal was asked by Økologisk Jordbrug how many organic farmer were actually in "over supply" due to a professor at the Aarhus School of business claimed that there was 1.000 organic farmers in over supply caused by the ove supply of organic milk.&#xD;
Paul Rye Kledal calculated together with the Danish Agricultural Advisory Service, National Centre in Aarhus, Jutland. &#xD;
&#xD;
700 organic farmers were in oversupply and based on those numbers the article discusses how organic farmers also will be hit by the decline in farms as well as growth in size.</dc:description>
