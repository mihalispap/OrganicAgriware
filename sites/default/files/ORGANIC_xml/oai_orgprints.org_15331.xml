  <dc:description>Late blight still is an unsolved problem in organic potato farming. Up to now the most effective way to control this disease is the use of copper fungicides. Transferring results from regular farming, seed treatments with copper fungicides shall postpone the beginning of the blight epidemic and decrease the spread of the disease with soil water. Thus stem blight, which canâ€™t be prevented otherwise, shall be reduced. In field trials, conducted 2005-2007, copper fungicide treatments reduced primary stem infections (stem blight) and the spreading of the pathogen from infected seed tubers.</dc:description>
