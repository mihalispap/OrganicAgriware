  <dc:description>There is a widespread assumption that conversion of livestock production systems in the uplands can be achieved with minimal change to existing hill farming practices and yet still deliver environmental and financial benefits. This assumption needs to be examined because conversion of upland farm enterprises poses particular issues for organic farming, Frost (1999). The certifying bodies acknowledge that some of these issues are not adequately covered by the current standards for organic agriculture. The development of a hill farming organic system at Pwllpeiran was established to provide evidence for such an appraisal, Powell (1999).&#xD;
&#xD;
Appraisal of the project indicates that organic beef and sheep production can be a viable option in the uplands. Long term maintenance of clover content, the relationship between organic production, environmental conservation and veterinary treatment of livestock remain issues that require longer term study.</dc:description>
