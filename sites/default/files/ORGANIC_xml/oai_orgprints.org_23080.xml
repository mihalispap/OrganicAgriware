  <dc:description>The problem of rural-urban migration in Nigeria has resulted in very dense urban populations. The location of poultry and aquaculture enterprises in urban and peri-urban areas of the country has exacerbated the problem of pollution. However, these wastes can be a valuable resource for use in agriculture, thereby offering a solution to pollution arising from intensive peri-urban aquaculture, thereby offering a solution to pollution arising from intensive peri-urban aquaculture and poultry enterprises. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of fibre glass fish tank effluent,poultry manure, NPK and control on two eggplant varieties and weeds. The response of eggplant fruit yield to poultry manure was significant and greater than the response to fish effluent, which also gave higher yield than NPK fertilizer or control. The fruit yield obtained from poultry manure was higher than the yield from fish effluent, NPK and control by 61%, 177% and 148%, respectively.  Fish effluent gave fruit yield that was higher than that from NPK by 72% and control by 55%. Kaduna variety produced yield that was superior by 71% and had lower weed density compared to Ngwa local</dc:description>
