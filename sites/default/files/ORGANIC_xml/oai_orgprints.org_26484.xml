  <dc:description>Extended and short abstracts for the conference "Dioxin 2014": A feeding experiment was set up on an organic farm where four groups of layers were used with 37 hens in each.&#xD;
Two groups of hens received a supplement of 15 g larvae per hen per day, while two control groups received&#xD;
only compound feed. The duration of the feeding experiment was two month. Samples of fly larvae, poultry&#xD;
manure, compost and compound feed as well as pooled egg samples from each group were analysed for levels of&#xD;
dioxins and PCB</dc:description>
