  <dc:description>The switch to organic farming may be the biggest farm management decision you ever undertake so careful planning is essential. The vast majority of organic farmers have no regrets once converted.  Organic farming can be a profitable option due mainly to lower costs of production, an attractive organic farming scheme and attractive market premiums.  However the change requires preparation, an attention to detail and good husbandry skills - a poor conventional farmer may make an even worse organic farmer.  From the financial viewpoint, the Teagasc “Farm Business Planner” program will help you in making the decision to convert or not.  Like conventional farming, organic farmers should not solely depend on unsustainable schemes and grant aid for future profits.  The organic market is a “niche” but growing market and it is important to follow that market.</dc:description>
