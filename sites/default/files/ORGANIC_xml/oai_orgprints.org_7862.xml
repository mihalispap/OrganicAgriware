  <dc:description>SIMBIO-VEG is the first large interdisciplinary research project on organic farming ever being funded in Italy. The project partnership is composed of eight Working Units including Universities as well as public and private research centres and associa-tions, with a high degree of interaction among them. SIMBIO-VEG aims to acquire knowledge on the func-tioning of organic arable and vegetable cropping systems, as to (1) optimise systems management and the cultural practices (methods) therein, and improve the understanding of how organic systems and meth-ods influence produce quality and environmental impact. SIMBIO-VEG activities are structured in four strongly integrated research lines. Line 1 aims to understand the functioning of organically-managed agroecosystems and evaluate the technical and agro-nomic feasibility of crop production methods applied therein. Line 2 aims to evaluate the effects of organic systems and methods on overall produce quality, including both standard and innovative methods. Line 3 aims to evaluate the sustainability of organic sys-tems and methods through assessment of parameters and indicators related to soil quality, environmental impact, and economic viability. Lastly, line 4 is aimed to favour diffusion of results and innovation transfer through a comprehensive set of activities.</dc:description>
