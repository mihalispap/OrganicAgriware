  <dc:description>In the last years the contro I 01 the apple sawfly Hoplocampa testudinea Klug was not efficient in organic Iruit growing. This was due to quality problems 01 the "Quassia wood" used lor the treatments. First orientating criteria based on one 01 the active ingredients, Quassin, were established lor the quality 01 "Quassia" preparations. A lield test on apple sawfly showed, that the quantity 01 Quassin per ha required lor good sawfly control is about 12-18 9 Quassin. In the nex! years, more active ingredients (Le. Neoquassin) have to be included in the quality criteria and evaluated by biotests. Only this way, reliable recommendations can be given to the growers.&#xD;
NeemAzal-T/S was effective only against the secondary inlestation. Thus, it can be recommended only in situations with low inlestation. The combination with Quassia (12 9 Quassin/ ha) did not give better results than Quassia alone. Antileedant effects have to be considered and may provocate antagonistic effects.</dc:description>
