  <dc:description>Soils in the Nordic countries are threatened, primarily by erosion, compaction, and loss of OM. The EU Soil Thematic Strategy has suggested a Framework for implementation of tools to counteract the threats to a sustained soil quality. Soil scientists should take part in this process and accept the need to do so in a close cooperation with stakeholders and fellow col-leagues in related scientific branches. The diversity of soils calls for the development of GIS-based tools to identify the best strategy at given locations. An isolated focus on soil quality indicators in monitoring programmes is strongly discouraged.</dc:description>
