  <dc:description>Abstract â€“ Seed-borne diseases are increasingly becoming important in organic farming, therefore effective seed treatment methods are urgently needed. Physical methods have efficacy against a number of seed-borne pathogens, but may have adverse effects if applied at too high intensity. Thermal treatment in water has the widest application. To control the loose smuts of wheat and barley it is still the only available non-chemical sanitation method. Other physical treatment methods with practical relevance in cereals are hot humid air and electron treatment. Hot water treatment is also known to control different seed-borne pathogens of vegetables. Various preparations of microorganisms, plant extracts and other agents of natural origin have been and are still being tested in cereals and vegetables. In cereals, some of them are already applied commercially.</dc:description>
