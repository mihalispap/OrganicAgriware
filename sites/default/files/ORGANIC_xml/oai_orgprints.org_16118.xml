  <dc:description>In few years Danish organic protein crops may be used as ingredients in feed for organic fish in partial replacement of fish meal protein. Fish meal is currently the primary protein source in feed for organic fish. Fish meal is manufactured by industrial fish caught among sustainable stocks, but even natural this protein source is not defined as organic and is as well a limited resource. &#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore, it is necessary to replace as much as possible of the fish meal protein with competitive organic vegetable protein sources with high protein content as well as a relevant amino acid composition compared to that in fish meal. Opposite optimization of conventional fish feed the regulation does not allow addition of artificial amino acids to feed for organic fish.</dc:description>
