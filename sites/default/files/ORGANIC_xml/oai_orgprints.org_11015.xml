  <dc:description>Organic farming is recognised in the European Union as one possible model to improve the sustainability of agriculture. During the 1990s the sector grew rapidly (to 3% of agricultural area in 2000), caused in part by policy support measures in member states and the EU. The paper summarises the development of the organic sector, discusses reasons for policy support, and reviews the main policy measures at EU and country level in three areas: legislation defining organic production, direct payments and other measures. It concludes that in future the integration of policy measures within countries and at EU level should be improved, in particular through the development of national and European action plans for organic farming.</dc:description>
