  <dc:description>When supporting the organic sector, the specific needs of retailers and processors have to be taken into account, because these actors bear similar risks and higher costs by conversion to organic products like farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
Therefore projects should be supported which reduce the transaction cost of organic food processing, wholesaling and retailing and provide information (e.g. access to more valuable market information/data) and services.&#xD;
&#xD;
Consumer communication has to be focussed on credibility, emotions and more on consequences of buying organic food as to transport just technical aspects of standards.</dc:description>
