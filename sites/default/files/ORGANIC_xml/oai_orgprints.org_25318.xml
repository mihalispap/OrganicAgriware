  <dc:description>Seeds form the basis for agricultural production, but most organic growers know little about how their seedstocks have been produced. Within the organic movement the discussion on the compatibility of plant breeding techniques has been accelerated by the public discussion on genetic engineering. This decision-making is important to develop a framework for organic plant breeding and facilitate investment by breeding companies. This dossier explains all standard techniques used in modern plant breeding and why they have been developed. The consequences of not allowing certain techniques for organic plant breeding are outlined, along with suggestions for alternative techniques that could be adopted.</dc:description>
