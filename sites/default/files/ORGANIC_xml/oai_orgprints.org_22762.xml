  <dc:description>In spite of the growing demand in green vegetables from three main cities in São Paulo State, smallscale vegetable farmers are still facing economic problems. Subsequently, the maintenance of small farmers and families depending solely on agriculture appears as very difficult. Organic Farming (OF) is increasingly considered as a possible alternative for designing a "new rural" in Brazilian communities (Abreu, 2000). It is seen as an opportunity for economic valuation of horticulture products (root, fruit and leaf vegetables for salads). The existing demand for this type of product, together with favorable green market prices, especially during summertime, would both stimulate and propitiate an expansion in production (Assis, 2002). The consumer of organics also expects a product that has certified or guaranteed quality, and such standards are not yet fully stabilized in Brazil. Organic farming is also considered as a way to preserve environment; although this attribute is not always recognized by consumers. However, the ways small farmers adopt OF in new peripheral “green belts” (Ueno, 1985) to conquest a urban demand in organics have not been investigated extensively. We explored this issue with a case study in the wide community of Ibiuna, located close to three main cities of São Paulo state, comprising together 20 million inhabitants. This study shows how small farmers were organised or organise themselves to meet urban demands and develop organic production. It explores a diversity of  evelopment models of horticulture organic farming, based on four forms of social organizations which are characterized and discussed.</dc:description>
