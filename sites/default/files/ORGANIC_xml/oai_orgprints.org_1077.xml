  <dc:description>At two sites in the Armenhof district, 10 km east of Fulda, Germany, dew samples were collected from June 1996 to June 1997 and investigated for free and protein bound amino acids. On account of the high pollen content, at the beginning of June 1996 and in May 1997 total amino acid concentrations were 53 – 390 µmol/l, in one sample 922 µmol/l. At other times the concentration in dew was 8 to 164 µmol/l. On 4 and 5 June 96 the diluted free amino acid fraction (DFAA) of the total hydrolyzed amino acids (THAA) at both sites amounted to 35 – 44% and was predominantly arginine, proline and glutamine/glutamate. Likewise on 11th  of March 97 the fraction of  DFAA was found to be 39.5% with extremely high arginine and proline fractions. At other times the  DFAA-fraction was in the range 14 – 26%.&#xD;
From July 1996 to June 1997 the amino acid concentrations in the vapours rising from a meadow were also measured and ranged from 8 to 51 µmol/l. From July to October 1996 the amino acid composition in the hydrolysates of dew samples and meadow vapours collected overnight were almost identical. The  DFAA-fraction  in the condensation water collected overnight from the meadow varied from 18 to 40%.&#xD;
From 4 to 6 June 96, on 11th  and 13th  of March 97 and in the period 16 to 20  May 97, the amino acid distribution in dew showed much variation. The percentage fraction of arginine and proline in the hydrolysate increased greatly whereas that of glycine and serine decreased. The large increase in proline and arginine in hydrolysate is attributable solely to the large amounts of free arginine and proline. This effect occurred in both 1996 and 1997 over several days at both sites at any one time and therefore appears confirmed.</dc:description>
