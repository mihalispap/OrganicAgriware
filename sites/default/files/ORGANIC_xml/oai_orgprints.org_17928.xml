  <dc:description>2009 witnessed several major developments in the field of standards and regulations. The new EU regulation on organic production came into force as well as the Canadian organic standard. Furthermore, the Australian domestic organic standard was implemented. Between Canada and the U.S., the worldâ€™s first fully reciprocal agreement between regulated organic systems was concluded and the EU started the procedures for approving certification bodies from outside the EU. It is expected that these developments will ease trade with organic products and foster future growth of the sector.</dc:description>
