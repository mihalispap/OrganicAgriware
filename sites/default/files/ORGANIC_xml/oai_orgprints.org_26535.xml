  <dc:description>In a feeding trial 450 layer chickens were fed either of 3 isoenergetic diets supplemented with different fish meal, grounded fly meal (Musca domestica) or fly meal and fresh fly larvae. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possibility of feeding grounded fly larva to layer chickens as an alternative protein source for fish meal in organic poultry. Parameters investigated were weight gain, food consumption, animal behavior and study whether it would have effect on intestinal health.</dc:description>
