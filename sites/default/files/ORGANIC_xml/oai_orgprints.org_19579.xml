  <dc:description>Effects to ethanol: Storing with additives increased the yield of sugars in enzymatic hydrolysis. Water soluble sugars well preserved. Some cellulose hydrolysed during ensiling. Storing altered the structure of the substrate?&#xD;
Suffered from acid formation when no additives were supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
Effects to methane: Storing with or without additives increased methane yield. Formed acids were utilized, as well as the preserved water soluble sugars. &#xD;
Prolonged storing seemed to decrease methane yields.</dc:description>
