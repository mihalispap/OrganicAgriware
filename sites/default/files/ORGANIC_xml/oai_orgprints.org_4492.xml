  <dc:description>The conversion to organic farming already means a contribution to nature conservation and landscape development. In a case study 16 organic farms in Germany were investigated whose farmers try to integrate such goals actively by certain measures into their farming system. The contribution of these farms to diverse landscapes is obvious. The motives of the farmers are strongly based upon intrinsic values. However, organic farming also shows a tendency towards intensification. Support is needed, not only with financial tools. The approach of a special advisory service at farm level can help to optimize the impact of organic farms upon the environment.</dc:description>
