  <dc:description>In May 2001 different plant oils, lime sulfur, starch, Na-bicarbonate and three concentrations of salt were proofed for their suitability for thinning blossoms at the apple variety Pinova. The trees grew in a conventionally treated part of the experimental orchard in Heuchlingen. The experiment had the character of a screening. Side effects like russeting and damages of blossom or leaves were registered too.</dc:description>
