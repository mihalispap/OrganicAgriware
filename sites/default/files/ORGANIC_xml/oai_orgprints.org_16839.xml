  <dc:description>The aim of this review is to illustrate how physical properties are important to food processing and quality. Three food products, flakes, porridge and bread, in addition to oat groats are used to show the influence of water and heat-treatments on the mechanical properties. The hydrothermal history of ingredients is shown to affect product quality. Water acts as a plasticiser and solvent in these foods, whilst heat modifies the conformation and interactions of macromolecular components. Structure as well as chemical composition is shown to govern texture.</dc:description>
