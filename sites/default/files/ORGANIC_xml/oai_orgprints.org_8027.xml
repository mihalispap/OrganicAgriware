  <dc:description>Abstract - A representative household panel is a good and reliable instrument for analysing different kinds of markets. It delivers quantative data which can be observed over a long period of time, therefore trends can be derivated. In terms of organic markets data is not fully reliable as consumers have to enter their shopping into a diary and not all the entries can be checked if they are complete and true. But we know from qualitative interviews that consumers tend to say that they buy a high percentage of organic products which does not reflect their real shopping behaviour – their answers therefore are rather socially motivated than true. Household panel can therefore be one instrument among of others for analysing organic markets. There will hardly be a chance to find one single tool for market analysis. The main aim and the steps to take should be to &#xD;
1. find the most effective tools for evaluating the one side of production, and the other of in-home and out of home consumption.&#xD;
2. find a way to bring this data together for estimations of market size and developments in past and future times.&#xD;
3. harmonize methodologies, instruments and data within the EU.&#xD;
