  <dc:description>In organic farming, the use of synthetically produced amino acids is not permitted and as of the year 2011, EU-Reg. 2092/91 requires the exclusive use of organically pro-duced animal feedstuffs. The amino acids requirements must be satisfied with the protein rich feed components. Therefore, the content of protein and amino acids was determined in different grain legumes such as peas, field beans, white and blue lu-pines and some cereals (oat, barley and wheat). The well-defined material from the years 2002-2005 came from field trials at the experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (FAL) in Trenthorst. The data were compared with standard values from the literature. The deviations of data on protein and amino acids for conven¬tionally and the organically grown feedstuffs were clear. For the calculation of the feed rations in the organic livestock husbandry the standard tabular values are not suffi-cient. But there are also clear deviations to the tabular values of organically produced feedstuffs. The contents of protein and amino acids in the analysed materials were significantly different between the years. A satisfying calculation of feed rations de-mands an exact knowledge of the contents of the feed components. Due to the almost total renunciation of external inputs, it is difficult to reduce the variations between the years, which result from weather conditions, crop rotation or variety.</dc:description>
