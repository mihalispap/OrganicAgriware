  <dc:description>The authors emphasize the importance of reflecting values in relation to organic food production especially because both the standards for organic food processing and the value discussion are almost non-existing related to processing. There are two main claims in this paper. One claim is that there could be reluctance from the companies in discussing organic values because they fear to be associated with the organic pioneer movement and subsequently exclusion from mainstream. Another claim is that there is a need for upgrading the existing networks or maybe invite to creation of new networks around reflection on values since this issue need qualification in order to be used as an active for the companies</dc:description>
