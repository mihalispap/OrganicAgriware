  <dc:subject>Farming Systems</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The contemporary state of farming has been evaluated and organic and conventional farming systems have been compared in the framework of the analysis of structure of farming in the Czech republic. The selective group of 437 associations, consisted of 3 subgroups, is divided into several categories according to the farming method and altitude. Parametres of plant and animal production and use of the agroenvironmental programmes and measures are evaluated. The evaluation of the structure of farming permits to find optimal possibilities of future development of conventional and organic farming in the Czech republic and of arrangements of the settings of grants and subsidies.</dc:description>
