  <dc:description>Organic winter wheat production is limited by climatic and agronomic factors, including weed competition. The incidence of weeds on yield limitation can be characterized through various early indicators to predict weed occurrence and competition. A network of 10 fields of organic winter wheat was implemented in the South East of France in 2005-2006. Results showed that weed density, dynamics and diversity are good indicators for weed occurrence and competition.</dc:description>
