  <dc:description>The Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotasara decemlineata Say) is one of the most important pests on potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). In the present study, we compared the efficacy of three biological insecticides – Neem (NeemAzal-T/S), pyrethrum/rapeseed oil (Spruzit Neu) and Bacillus thuringiensis var. tenebrionis (Novodor FC) – against this pest in field trials conducted from 2005 to 2007. The combined and temporarily shifted application of neem and B.t.t. reduced significantly the number of beetle larvae and the percentage of defoliation due to larval feeding, and increased the potato yield considerably. The SIMLEP3 forecasting model is useful for determining the optimal timing of the treatment. Pyrethrum/rapeseed oil did not lead to a significant reduction of Colorado potato beetle larvae.</dc:description>
