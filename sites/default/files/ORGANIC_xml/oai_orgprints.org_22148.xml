  <dc:description>It cannot be generally recommended to use older varieties unless quality aspect are reflected in the price, but some old varieties were compatible with the commonly grown modern varieties. The results calls for targeted breeding for low input conditions, as breeding for high input condition contribute little to the benefit of organic agriculture and other low input conditions. Research is needed to quantify the effect of the different yield components of breeding on grain and straw yield and quality at low input conditions.</dc:description>
