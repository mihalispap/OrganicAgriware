  <dc:description>Beneficial invertebrate activity (13 groups) was assessed in five crop types on a split-plot experimental system in northern England using pitfall trapping and suction sampling in May-October 2005. Very significant differences were detected in activity between crop type, and in the preference of groups for individual crops. Within crop types, differences in fertiliser and crop protection approaches appeared to significantly affect activity, with preferences for either organic or conventional management differing between groups. In general, inorganic fertiliser application had more effect on activity than pesticide, herbicide and fungicide use.</dc:description>
