  <dc:description>Organic poultry production has substantially increased in the last few years. On organic farms, welfare of poultry is enhanced due to enriched housing conditions as access to a&#xD;
free range area. This may reduce feather pecking and keep the health status at least on the same level as on conventional farms. However, welfare of organic poultry may be further improved if: (a) laying hens are already reared in enriched systems that are close to the systems in the layer house, (b) a frequent and even use of the run, (c) selection of suitable genotypes especially in relation to digestive ability, and (d) effective prevention&#xD;
and control of parasites.</dc:description>
