  <dc:description>An experiment was conducted to examine the extent of root and canopy interference of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) with sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.).  Sowthistle was surrounded with either two or eight chickpea plants. There were different types of competition: no competition, shoot competition, root competition and full competition (root and shoot). The performance of sowthistle grown in full competition with two chickpea plants was the same as that grown with root competition only.  Also, there were no significant differences between sowthistle grown with chickpea canopy shade and the control, where there was no competition. On the other hand sowthistle grown with eight neighbours was significantly suppressed in full, canopy or root competition.</dc:description>
