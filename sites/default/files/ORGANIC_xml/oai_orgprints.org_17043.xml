  <dc:description>Organic farming/products are becoming very necessary in todayâ€™s world to control ecosystem health and to impart related human health benefits, world over there is growing demand for organic produce. A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of Kilpest India Ltd., Bhopal, during 2009 on rice using BGA Chlorella pyrenoidosa and Nostoc muscorum and biological hydrolysate of Soybean .These treatments were compared with recommended dose of Fytozyme. Currently, fytozyme (40% chemically hydrolysed protein solution) is being used as organic fertilizer world over which was taken as positive control. Cost of all the organic amendments were considered and kept at par with the Fytozyme. Results revealed a significant increase in growth parameters and straw yield in plot treated with Chlorella pyrenoidosa. Grain yield was also higher in C. pyrenoidosa (3.35 t/ha) followed by Fytozyme (3.05 t/ha) and Nostoc as well as biological Soy hydrolysate (both 2.81 t/ha). Thus concluding a better viable organic product.</dc:description>
