  <dc:description>FAO and Agriculture leaders recognize the contribution of Organic Agriculture to environmental and social issues, but they question that organic could produce enough affordable food for the growing demand of the population if it were a global agriculture strategy. Ecological and social intensification has been the concept of IFOAM and the Organic Movement to address these doubts. While the IAASTD report stated in 2008 that "business as usual is not an option anymore", industrial, strategies reminiscent of the so-called Green Revolution are still pushed in the concept for the UN Year of Family Farming (2014). The benefits of Organic agriculture over the present conventional paradigm, with regard to providing nourishment to all, are not yet universally accepted.</dc:description>
