  <dc:description>The root rot disease complex is a limiting factor in organic production of cool season crops. This study aimed to increase seedling stands of peas and spinach by altering the seed environment such that the growing conditions of the seeds were favored over those of the pathogens. We compared treatments of raised (ridged) seed beds, dairy and vermicompost troughs, transplanting, and a biocontrol soil drench. Of the methods tested, transplanting provided the most reliable and best crop stands for both seasons (p=0.05) Since this method relies on the biological resistance the plants develop naturally with age, this method could prove applicable across many climates and other crops which are threatened by root rot.</dc:description>
