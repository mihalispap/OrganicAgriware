  <dc:description>The occurrence of health and welfare problems is probably different in organic pig herds compared to conventional production systems. Improved management in the individual herd may reduce problems and to ensure a high level of animal health and product safety it is necessary to be able to monitor and assess risk factors present in the herd. An expert panel of 10 Danish and Swedish veterinarians and pig production advisers has assisted in the selection of common health and welfare problems in organic pig herds and the identification of risk factors. Important health and welfare problems and the corresponding risk factors are presented in the text. Based on this a HACCP programme for organic pig farmers as a management tool is currently being developed.</dc:description>
