  <dc:description>Knowledge about organic agriculture is constantly changing and growing. Research related to organic agriculture at EU level nowadays plays an important role. Organic agriculture, being an integrated, holistic and multi-target approach, needs researchers who are trained to investigate poly-factorial and multi-level problems.  For students and junior scientists, international seminars and exchange programs are necessary instruments to gain “state of the art” knowledge and skills from senior scientists in the field of organic agriculture. The QLIF training programme under WP7.4 provides training in the different aspects of ecological farming systems, but also offers an opportunity to discuss relevant and adequate research strategies and results. Within the EU sixth framework QLIF project, so far two seminars have been organized. Contents and impact of these seminars are discussed.</dc:description>
