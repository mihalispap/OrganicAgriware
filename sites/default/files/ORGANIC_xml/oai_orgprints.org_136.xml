  <dc:description>Grain legumes have three major functions in cropping systems: 1) to produce feed and food protein, 2) to contribute N to the cropping system via symbiotic N2 fixation, and 3) to serve as a break-crop in cereal-rich rotations. Depending on specific farming system principles these functions have different priorities. Some conventional systems may focus on protein production whereas organic farming systems try to integrate them all.&#xD;
Symbiotic N2 fixation (SNF) is a unique biological process influenced by several environmental factors; optimising SNF is not an easy task. Integrated management of crop rotation should be considered to combine and exploit better the specific characteristics of each crop (self-sufficient or not in N, different C/N ratio, more or less rapid residue mineralisation, etc.).</dc:description>
