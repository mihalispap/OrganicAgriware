  <dc:description>From the barriers said to potentially hamper the further development of the sector, the consumer demand side and herein the high prices are handled as crucial. We reviewed the literature since 2000 regarding the role of perceived price and income. We find that self-report based studies nearly unequivocally find price is the primary barrier to choice, deviations from this appear to occur when researching organic consumers and developed organic markets. There are mixed findings regarding income, but representative studies tend to indicate a significant influence. Number and age of children and income level are found to impact the influence of income on intention to or purchase of organic food.</dc:description>
