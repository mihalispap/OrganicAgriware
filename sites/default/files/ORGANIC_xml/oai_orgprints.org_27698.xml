  <dc:description>In this study carried out in Isparta province of Turkey in 2005 and 2006, it was determined how ellagic acid and nitrate contents of fruit were affected from some application performed in organic and conventional strawberry production. In the study, 18 different application were made at Camarosa strawberry cultivar. The plants were planted as frigo seedlings in the third week of July and irrigated by drip irrigation method. According to the results; ellagic acid contents were ranged from 0.487 to 0.498 mg 100g-1 and there were no significant differences among values. Nitrate contens were ranged from 1.43 to 4.57 mg kg-1 and there were significant differences among values.</dc:description>
