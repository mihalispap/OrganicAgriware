  <dc:description>A range of comparative studies have recently been carried out to compare the composition of foods produced in organic, “low input” and conventional production systems. This paper will review the currently available information on nutritional differences between organic and non-organic crops. It will also describe the Nafferton Factorial Systems Experiment which was established as part of the IP Quality-LowInputFood to study the effect (and interactions between) (a) rotational design, (b) fertility management and (c) crop protection regimes on crop quality and safety.</dc:description>
