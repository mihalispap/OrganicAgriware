  <dc:description>There is concern whether consuming products based on crop from Chlormequat-treated fields can cause reproduction problems in animals and humans. An experiment is presently being conducted to investigate this using the pig as a model. Considerations with regard to experimental design when investigating whether differently treated crop can affect animal/human biology is discussed. Only about half of the data are presently available. A preliminary survey of these data does not show clear differences between Chlormequat-treated and organic non-treated wheat with regard to reproduction performance of pigs.</dc:description>
