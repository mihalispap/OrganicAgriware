  <dc:description>Crop, weeds and arthropods were sampled in conventionally and organically cultivated spring- and winter-sown cereal fields. Weed biomass was much higher in organically cultivated fields, while arthropod biomass hardly showed any differences. Results from very weedy areas of organically grown fields indicate that a more extensive management allowing even more weeds may be favourable to insects and the animals feeding on them.</dc:description>
