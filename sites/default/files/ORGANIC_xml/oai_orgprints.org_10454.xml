  <dc:description>In perennial grasslands R. obtusifolius (broad-leaved dock) is often surrounded by certain plant species. Thus, it is hypothesized for the current study that Rumex can affect their neighbouring plant species by allelopathic interactions. To test this hypothesis, in a series of laboratory and field experiments aqueous extracts of green R. obtusifolius leaves were sprayed on seeds of 14 herbaceous plant species (graminoids, non-leguminuous forbs and leguminuous forbs) commonly native to perennial grasslands and its effects on seed germination compared with those with tap water spraying. An allelopathic effect was defined as inhibitory influence of Rumex extracts on seed germination relative to tap water. Generally, results of the laboratory experiments showed a species-specific susceptibility of grassland species to Rumex extracts; no species was promoted by Rumex extracts. All grasses tested were heavily inhibited by Rumex extracts, herbs and legumes varied from not affected until heavily inhibited. Spraying of Rumex extracts in the field had no effect on germination of these species. The results could be considered in designing seeding mixtures for resowing sward damages to especially contain species not susceptible to Rumex allelopathy (e.g. Trifolium pratense, T. repens, Plantago lanceolata) that would thus be assumed to be more competitive against R. obtusifolius regrowing in these grasslands.</dc:description>
