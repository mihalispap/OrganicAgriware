  <dc:title>Birds Benchmark Study. Sheepdrove Organic Farm 2003</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Sheepdroveâ€™s bird community includes many birds of conservation concern, in a substantial area of land farmed organically. The standard BBS (Breeding Bird Survey) sampling method was used to record bird species and counts at Sheepdrove Organic Farm during 2003 in 3 sampling areas (each 1km square). Normally BBS is only carried out during breeding season, but to gather broader data, extra survey visits were also carried out including autumn and winter surveys for records of winter migrants. Many common species were observed, and often those expected at farmland, including several species which have declined nationwide - birds of conservation concern on the Red and Amber List of the BTO (British Trust for Ornithology). There was an unusual sighting of Ring Ouzel, and also of Barn Owl, which is often missed during daytime surveys. Due to the extra survey visits, records were taken for winter migrants such as Fieldfare, and the incidence of winter flocks, e.g. of finches and Starling (many of which will be winter migrants). The results of this survey will serve as a benchmark for the biodiversity records of Sheepdrove Organic Farm.</dc:description>
