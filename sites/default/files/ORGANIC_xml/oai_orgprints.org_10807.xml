  <dc:description>Slugs are the most common and widespread pest affecting all farmers and growers. There are 29 species of slugs in the UK. The most destructive are from the Deroceras, Arion and Malix groups. Very few crops are unaffected as slugs are polyphagus and feed throughout the year whenever conditions are cool/warm and damp. With FYM &amp; green manures, soil organic matter levels are increased which favours slugs. Snails tend to be less important, but can cause problems in gardens and on cane fruits.  This technical note discusses natural enemies of slugs, nature of damage, life history and control measures, and lists sources of further information.</dc:description>
