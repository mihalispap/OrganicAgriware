  <dc:description>Natural compounds were sprayed according the RimPro scab warning system from start of bud break until the mid of June. Scab incidence was measured on the leaves and the fruit. Phytotoxicitiy and russet-ing was assessed. The natural compounds were sprayed together with sulphur and were compared with the standard biological fungicides copper hy-droxide and sulphur alone. Compound E73 + sulphur was the most effective on fruit. Armicarb and Resis-tim both sprayed with sulphur were comparable in efficacy with Funguran-OH. In our study laminarin (GL 32) did not shown any effect on the control of scab on apple.</dc:description>
