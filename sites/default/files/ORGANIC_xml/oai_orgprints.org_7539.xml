  <dc:description>A pilot study carried out in 2002/2003 (50 farms) revealed that production diseases such as mastitis, lameness and metabolic disorders play a considerable role in german organic dairy farming. In a follow-up project, an intervention study on lameness is currrently being carried out in 43 cubicle housed Holstein Friesian herds. Farms are monitored at 3-months intervals for two years. The average baseline lameness prevalence was 26%. Preliminary findings suggest a beneficial effect of access to pasture during summer and improvements due to intervention measures (housing, management) taken in approximately half of the farms. In a third step, herd health plans with regard to mastitis, lameness, metabolic disorders, reproductive disorders and calf diseases will be implemented on the project farms integrating farmers, veterinary practitioners and advisors.</dc:description>
