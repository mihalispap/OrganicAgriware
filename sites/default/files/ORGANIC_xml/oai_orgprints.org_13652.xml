  <dc:description>On the Russian market there are no currently registered biological preparations for the&#xD;
control of Rhagoletis cerasi (cherry fruit fly, CFF), and therefore the effects of natural&#xD;
products against this pest were studied. In laboratory, semi-field and field experiments a&#xD;
range of botanicals (NeemAzal-T/S and Quassia-MD) were tested alone and in&#xD;
combination with comparison product Phytoverm and chemical standard insecticides for&#xD;
their effectiveness against R. cerasi in commercial orchards. These products showed a&#xD;
high biological effectiveness against R. cerasi comparable with chemical insecticides.</dc:description>
