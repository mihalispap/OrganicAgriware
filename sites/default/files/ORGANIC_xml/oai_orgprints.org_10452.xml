  <dc:description>Broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius L., Polygonaceae) is an agronomically&#xD;
important perennial weed causing decreases in pasture yields and fodder quality.&#xD;
Non-chemical control measures for dock are often limited to frequent pulling and&#xD;
cutting, additionally it is usually avoided by grazing animals. Here, the regeneration of&#xD;
R. obtusifolius in a Rumex-infested grassland grazed by a sheep breed that explicitly&#xD;
feeds on dock (Ovis aries L. cv. East Prussian Skudden) was compared to cutting.&#xD;
Therefore, regeneration of 90 R. obtusifolius plants of three different size classes was&#xD;
monitored in three plots during three grazing and cutting cycles. Plant height and&#xD;
number of fruit-stands of regrown R. obtusifolius was significantly lower, number of&#xD;
leaves significantly higher after grazing than after cutting, while plant diameter was&#xD;
unaffected. Initially medium and large-sized plants (&gt;40 cm diameter) were significantly&#xD;
more sensitive to grazing or cutting than initially smaller sized plants. Soil&#xD;
nitrate and ammonium concentrations in the vicinity of R. obtusifolius correlated with&#xD;
some regrowth parameters but were not affected by grazing or cutting. Sheep-grazed&#xD;
grassland communities comprised fewer legumes (p=0.002), more grasses (p=0.010)&#xD;
and fewer sward gaps (p=0.025) than cut grassland. At the end of the experiment,&#xD;
abundance of R. obtusifolius in sheep grazed plots was lower than in cut plots&#xD;
(p=0.089) suggesting that regrowth potential of this weed was depleted by continuous&#xD;
grazing and higher sward density. In conclusion, these data suggest that sheep could&#xD;
be considered in grassland management schemes to both directly and indirectly control&#xD;
Rumex infestations.</dc:description>
