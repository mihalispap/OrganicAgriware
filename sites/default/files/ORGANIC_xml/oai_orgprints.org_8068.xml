  <dc:title>Predicting Consumer Choices of Organic Food: Results from the CONDOR Project</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Consumer issues</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Based on a survey in eight European countries, a model of consumer decision making and behaviour with regard to organic food is presented as well as comparative results. It is found that the reasons given and the reasoning behind choosing organic products are quite similar across countries, but that whereas behavioural intentions are predictive of behaviour in the North, this is not the case in the South of Europe. A framework for understanding the difference between North and South is presented.</dc:description>
