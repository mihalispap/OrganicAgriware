  <dc:description>This paper reviews major results achieved with physical weed control methods and strategies especially adapted for horticultural and agricultural crops. Mechanical methods, such as weed harrowing and inter-row hoeing, have provided promising results in cereals, pulse and oil seed rape, particularly when they are part of a strategy that also involves cultural methods such as fertiliser placement or crop seed vigour. In row crops, intra-row weeds constitute a major challenge, and research has mainly aimed at replacing laborious hand weeding with mechanization. A number of investigations have focussed on optimising the use of thermal and mechanical methods against intra-row weeds. And new methods are now under investigation such as robotic weeding for row crops with abundant spacing between individual plants and band-steaming for row crops developing dense crop stands.</dc:description>
