  <dc:description>The present study aims at understanding some of the dynamics of social change that are underlying the present waves of interest related to the bathroom by taking a practice-oriented hold of ‘what is going on’ with the way bathrooms are used and arranged today in a specific Danish context. Through this approach, typical bathroom practices are laid out, hereby pointing out important contemporary aspects of the way bathrooms are used and arranged. Following this, dynamics connected to the shaping process of these practices are studied by analysing how practitioners and producers of bathrooms form part of this shaping process and how this is related to the overall development of the bathroom.</dc:description>
