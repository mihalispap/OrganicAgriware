  <dc:description>The aim of this experiment was to evaluate influence of mulching on the tuber yield and on the number of ware potatoes. In organic farming grass mulch for potatoes was used in 2008. For the experiments different ways of mulching (grass mulch after planting, grass mulch after second hoeing) were used and compared with bare soil (control variant). The results showed that grass mulching had positive effect on the yield of ware potatoes and some of the yield-forming components. The yield of ware potatoes was significantly higher by 9.3 t/ha in comparison with control variant. The highest number of ware potatoes was found out in the variant with grass mulch after planting.</dc:description>
