  <dc:description>The purpose of this working paper is to give an overview of main results from previous studies on&#xD;
household demand for organic foods or alternatively for foods certified free-from-pesticideresidues.&#xD;
We have concentrated on studies handling&#xD;
• willingness-to-pay (in past as well as future WTP),&#xD;
• purchasing motives/valued product attributes,&#xD;
• concern for food safety, especially risk perception regarding pesticides,&#xD;
• consumers’ stated propensity to buy,&#xD;
• consumers’ willingness to accept lower quality of organic products,&#xD;
• the importance of labelling and information,&#xD;
• the importance of store choice, and&#xD;
• relations between consumers’ values, risk perception, attitudes and behaviour regarding environmental&#xD;
protection and WTP.&#xD;
These issues are handled to a various extent in the reviewed studies. Most of the studies handle&#xD;
household characteristics. In the paper, we give an overview of the influence from these characteristics.</dc:description>
