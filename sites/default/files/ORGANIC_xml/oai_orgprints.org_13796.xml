  <dc:description>The objective of REPCO is to contribute to the replacement of copper fungicides in organic agriculture by&#xD;
new measures for control of downy mildew (Plasmopara viticola) in grapevine and scab (Venturia inaequalis)&#xD;
in apple. Both major European organic crops strongly depend on copper fungicides. Permitted amounts will&#xD;
be reduced stepwise during the following years (Council Regulation (EEC) 2092/91, Annex II) to avoid&#xD;
environmental risks. In European countries where copper fungicides are already out of use, production of&#xD;
organic apples suffers severe economical problems because of insufficient scab control.&#xD;
Potentiators of resistance, organically based fungicides and biocontrol agents are screened and evaluated in&#xD;
apple. Effects of crop management practices in organic agriculture on overwintering of Venturia inaequalis&#xD;
are assessed. Novel disease control measures and knowledge are integrated into organic management&#xD;
systems. 'Pipeline' products already under development elsewhere are included and where necessary&#xD;
optimised in their use.</dc:description>
