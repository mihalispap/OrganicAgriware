  <dc:title>Product and process protection in the organic farming sector - organic terminology and image at risk</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>Pick, Doris</dc:creator>
  <dc:description>Abstract - Genetic Engineering seems to be one of the greatest threats to Organic and "low input" farming systems of our times for various reasons. This paper primarily focuses on the creep-ing dilution and takeover of organic Terminology by the Biotech sector in the fields of organic products, processes and re-search. It shows by means of a few selected case Studies from Europe and North America how consumers’ and politicians’ trust in organic processes, products and research may de-crease and the positive organic image may partly get lost over time if no adequate counter strategies are (further) developped and collectively implemented.</dc:description>
