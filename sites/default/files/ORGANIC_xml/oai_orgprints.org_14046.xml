  <dc:description>This paper reports the findings of two components of a research investigating the viability of organic wine grape production. Firstly the results of a survey of Australian organic wine grape growersâ€™ management practices and secondly the first year findings of an experimental organic vineyard compared to an associated conventional vineyard. The survey found a heavy reliance on sulphur and copper sprays for powdery and downy mildew control. The experimental vineyard showed similar yields to conventional growing and in many cases higher sugar, though some increase in botrytis in organic Shiraz.</dc:description>
