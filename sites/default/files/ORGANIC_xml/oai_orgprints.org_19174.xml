  <dc:description>This paper discusses the results of a survey conducted by the Organic Research Centreâ€™s Agroecology Programme to gain an understanding of how landowners in the UK are currently using the woody components on their land, in order to assess whether there is potential from landowners to gain more both economically and ecologically from the woody components. &#xD;
This survey was intended to reach a wide audience of landowners that practiced both organic and non-organic farming. Organisations that helped to distribute this survey are listed in Appendix 1. The survey was a voluntary online survey, therefore the assumption is that landowners that took part would have had an interest in this topic and therefore may not be representative of all UK landowners. &#xD;
From March 2011 to May 2011 57 landowners participated in this survey, and results from these landowners are discussed.</dc:description>
