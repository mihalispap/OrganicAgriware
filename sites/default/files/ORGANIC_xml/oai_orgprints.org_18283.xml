  <dc:description>Foods should be made available to deliver more grain fibre and outer layers of the grains,&#xD;
while also addressing the consumer expectations of palatability and convenience. This&#xD;
demands for new ingredients high in grain phytochemicals and with good technological&#xD;
properties. The natural diversity in grains offers a good basis for tailored fractionation&#xD;
and bioprocessing. The grain chain from plant breeding and crop selection should take&#xD;
into account the nutritional quality criteria set by the end-use. This was the approach in&#xD;
the EU integrated project HEALTHGRAIN running in 2005-2010 (www.healthgrain.org),&#xD;
which addressed the whole grain chain to provide consumers with healthy grain-based&#xD;
foods and ingredients (Poutanen et al 2008). It included studies of consumer&#xD;
expectations, development of a biotechnology toolbox for plant breeding, development of&#xD;
wet and dry milling and novel bioprocessing technologies for grain processing, studies of&#xD;
mechanisms behind the metabolic merits of foods in a series of in vitro, animal and&#xD;
human studies, and identification of health-relevant cereal food criteria.</dc:description>
