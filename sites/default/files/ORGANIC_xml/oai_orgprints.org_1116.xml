  <dc:description>In field trials, seed treatment with acetic acid has reduced common bunt (Tilletia tritici) in winter wheat by 91.5-96.2% and by 83% in spring wheat without negative effects on germination vigour of the seeds. Leaf stripe (Pyrenophora graminea) in spring barley was reduced by 93,4%. Acetic acid is a cheap and environmental friendly fungicide with a possible scope of application especially in organic agriculture, where conventional pesticides are prohibited.</dc:description>
