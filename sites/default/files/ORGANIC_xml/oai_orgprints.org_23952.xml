  <dc:description>Saline water and soils present an increasing problem for agriculture. Adaptation strategies of agriculture include selection of existing crops on salt tolerance, and development of new tolerant or halophyte crops. Saline areas are often located close to sensitive nature, and at least in The Netherlands, the development of saline crops represent a challenge to sustainable and organic agriculture.  &#xD;
We tested salt tolerance of two new plant species that have some prospects as future crops: Seakale and Seabeet. Due to the present market perspectives for Seakale, this plant was also tested as a crop on some larger scale. &#xD;
Results show that Seakale can be classified as salt-tolerant, whereas Seabeet can be classified as halophyte. While up scaling, Seakale shows problems with soils saturated with (fresh)water, and adapted management will be necessary. &#xD;
We conclude that the prospects for the development of saline crops are there. However, for practice there is still a long way to go.</dc:description>
