  <dc:description>The organic farming has rapidly expanded in Poland since the political change in 1989/90. Advisory service plays an important role in the special knowledge system of eco-farming. The main aim of the study was to describe the status quo of the advisory service of eco-farming in Poland and to develop references how to support it. The work followed an approach framed by empirical social research. The research adopted the perspective of experts (eco-advisors) and eco-farmers and is focused on the following areas: advisory system, approaches, communication and eco-network. Furthermore, the objective of the study was to identify areas where the advisory service is currently lacking. As a result can be seen: a lack of organisation of the advisory service, a discrepancy between demand and supply and a lack of skills (eco-advisors).</dc:description>
