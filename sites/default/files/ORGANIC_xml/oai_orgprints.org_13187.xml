  <dc:description>The paper is based on the OrganiST (Organic Shops in Tübingen) project. Its aim is to develop and discuss marketing strategies for smaller and regional oriented organic shops in order to stay attractive for their customers. &#xD;
The competition on the market for organic food has dramatically increased. In the investigated town, the competition will increase further, because an organic supermarket of a big chain has opened in autumn 2007. Some of the small and medium sized organic shops have come into troubles. They have problems to hold their regular customers and strategies to gain new customers are often lacking. &#xD;
The outcomes and recommendations of OrganiST shall help the shop owners to get aware on possible additional values they can integrate into their marketing strategy. The study will also elaborate some positive, successful examples of (small scale and regional geared) organic marketing tools. The results of the project will be presented at the conference.</dc:description>
