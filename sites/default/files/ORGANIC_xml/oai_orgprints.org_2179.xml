  <dc:description>Copper is a very common pesticide in organic viticulture, used against different diseases. But it is long term toxic for soils. That is why organic winegrowers try to reduce its use. Since 1988 ECO-Consult and the Organic Winegrowers Association of Germany (BÖW) has coordinated a on farm research program concerning copper reduction in organic vine protection. &#xD;
As a result of this reseach, the document outlines a plant protection strategy against Plasmopara viticola (downy mildew).&#xD;
Tables:&#xD;
- Use of Copper (kg/ha/a) by german organic wine growers in 1996 to 1998&#xD;
- Frequency of Plasmopara viticola infection on clusters in the years 1990 to 2000 (ring trial - on farm research)</dc:description>
