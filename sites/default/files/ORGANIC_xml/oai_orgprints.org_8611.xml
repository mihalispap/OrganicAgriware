  <dc:description>We examine the design of policies for promoting the consumption of green products under preference and income heterogeneity using organic products as an example. Two instruments are considered: a price subsidy for the organic products and a tax on the conventional products. Under income disparity, consumers with high income always prefer a socially optimal subsidy to a socially optimal tax, while low-income consumers prefer a tax on conventional products. When environmental policy is determined by the median voter, the policies implemented tend to be stricter than socially optimal policies if income differences are large.</dc:description>
