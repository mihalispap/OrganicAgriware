  <dc:description>Our working group aims to discuss successful approaches of managing increasing quantities of organic food produce - successful in terms of maintaining product quality, trust, integrity and higher value while at the same time increasing turnover. We will focus on two aspects in particular, firstly, the kinds and quality of cooperation of farmers with processors such as dairies, mills, bakeries or oil presses, and secondly, the successful management of growth in value chains including strategies, communication and limiting and enabling factors.</dc:description>
