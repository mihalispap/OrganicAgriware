  <dc:description>The aim of research was to find out the protective effect of companion plants against lygus bugs  (Lygus spp.) in organic production of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L..). The field experiment was conducted during 2004 and 2005. Bean were sown on three dates: May 10, 25, June 10. As companion plants the following species were applied: red beet (Beta vulgaris L.), dill (Anethum graveolens L.), marigold (Tagetes erecta L.) and sage (Salvia officinalis L..). At harvest the bean seeds were examined for the presence of seed-pitting caused  by lygus bugs. The lowest percentage of damaged seeds, demonstrated  the  samples obtained from plots cultivated in the close proximity of dill and marigold  The number of pitted seeds depended on the date of seeds sowing and the year of experiment.</dc:description>
