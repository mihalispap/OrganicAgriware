  <dc:description>The vast majority of farms worldwide are smallholder family farms that produce 70% of the world's food. There is a growing consensus that smallholders play a crucial role in food production as well as in rural development. Organic farming is recognized as a particularly suitable concept for smallholders, as it builds on diversity, multi-functionality and farm-based resources. However, in most places, agriculture is experiencing a process of structural change. People are moving out of agriculture, and those who remain manage larger farms. Contract farming and agri-businesses are on the rise.</dc:description>
