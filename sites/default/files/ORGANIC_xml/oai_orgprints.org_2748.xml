  <dc:description>Catering is beginning to be an important sales channel for organic foods in the Nordic countries. However implementing organic foods in today’s complex catering systems is far from easy. Therefore primary players in the fields of marketing and promotion or organic foods in catering have established a Nordic network. The Nordic network has been able to carry out a study on the perspectives in organic foods in catering through a grant from Nordic Industrial Fund and with the support from Danish Veterinary &amp; Food Administration and Danish Technical University. The study has resulted in this report, which is prepared on the basis of interview meetings in the five Nordic capitals. The study has been carried out in close cooperation with partners in each of the Nordic countries.</dc:description>
