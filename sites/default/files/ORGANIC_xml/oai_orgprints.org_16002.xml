  <dc:description>We have analyzed phenolic compounds from organically and conventionally grown blackcurrants and strawberries to test the idea if organically grown berries contain a higher amount of health-promoting phenolic compounds. &#xD;
Statistically significant differences between farms were found for almost all compounds. In strawberry, the impact of genotype and environment on the flavonol content was more important than the cultivation practice. The "health quality" from organically grown berries does not differ from those grown conventionally.</dc:description>
