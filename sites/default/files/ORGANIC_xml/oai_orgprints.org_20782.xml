  <dc:description>One of the central challenges for governments which want to develop new markets is to engage rele-vant market-actors within this process. Both the thesis and the following paper explore how govern-ments can deal with that challenge, by creating coordination between the relevant market actors and by that affect their engagement in developing the new market. The study focusses government sup-port for the development of organic consumption in Sweden and Denmark. It shows that in order to support the development of organic consumption the Danish government supported strong coordination between retailers and food companies – what paved the way for the creation of stable nation-wide distribution channels for organic food and for the active engagement of all Danish retailers in promoting organic consumption. In Sweden, in the contrary, the government supported only organic supply. As a result no coordination between retailers and food companies has been occurred – which was one of the reasons organic the Swedish organic market still remained a niche.</dc:description>
