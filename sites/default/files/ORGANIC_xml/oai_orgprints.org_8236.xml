  <dc:description>This paper was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference of the Colloquium of Organic Researchers (COR).&#xD;
The regulation for the assessment of the conversion to organic farming establishes the use of soil/produce pollution and the type of agricultural practices as indicators of performance. However, these indicators donâ€™t reflect the complexity of the soil ecosystem and soil health. Therefore, complementary indicators were sought (soil biostructure and field capacity), and a specific three-steps method for the assessment and monitoring of soil health during the conversion process was developed.</dc:description>
