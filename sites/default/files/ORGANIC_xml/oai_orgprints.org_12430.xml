  <dc:description>Poland, like all new European Union member states has experienced significant growth in organically managed land and the number of organic farms in the last few years. However, there are still many barriers to overcome to stimulate the consumption of organic foods. There is a need to learn more about the emotions, cognition and behaviour of Polish organic consumers in order to develop effective marketing strategies. Polish consumers are motivated to buy organic food because of its perceived health and safety attributes. The highest interest in organic food is observed among consumers who value animal welfare, environment protection and self-fulfilment.</dc:description>
