  <dc:description>Dark leaf spot caused by Alternaria brassicicola is a seed-borne disease of Brassicae. Production of healthy seed is essential for the organic vegetable production. Literature on the epidemiology of the disease in organic seed production of Brassica was reviewed and an epidemiological field experiments was carried out. External and internal contamination of seeds with A. brassicicola increased steadily during their development. Colonisation of pod tissues as quantified by TaqMan-PCR increased exponentially. The developed knowledge can be used for optimizing cropping systems for organic seed production with lower risks for seed contamination by Alternaria spp. and to develop critical control points for disease management.</dc:description>
