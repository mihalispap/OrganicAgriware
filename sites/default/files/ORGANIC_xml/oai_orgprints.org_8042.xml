  <dc:description>Danish farmers are required to grow around 300.000 hektares of catch crops each year, as part of the Danish regulations of N use and losses from agriculture. The rules set some minimum requirements about how to grow catch crops, but do not attempt to optimize the effects of the catch crops. In the paper it is discussed how farmers can improve the effects of catch crops, both the environmental effects and the effects on nitrogen supply for succeeding agricultural crops. It is shown that it is highly important which plant species are grown, as there are large differences in their root growth and winter hardines. It is also shown that the species choice may have suprising large effects on the N supply for the succeeding crop.</dc:description>
