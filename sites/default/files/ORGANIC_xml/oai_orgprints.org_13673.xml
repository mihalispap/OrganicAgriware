  <dc:description>In a pilot field study conducted in an apple orchard in Hardanger (Western Norway) in two&#xD;
succesive years both Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae were applied to&#xD;
apple trees just after hatching of mirid nymphs in spring. Both predatory, omnivorous and&#xD;
principally plant-pathogenic species of mirids were collected, and all groups of species&#xD;
were infected by B. bassiana or M. ansiopliae in treated plots. B. bassiana and M.&#xD;
anisopliae were also found on some individuals in non treated control plots the second&#xD;
year. M. anisopliae was more predominant in 2006, B. bassiana in 2007. Mirids were also&#xD;
observed for natural occurrence of parasitoids, and parasitoids were found both years.</dc:description>
