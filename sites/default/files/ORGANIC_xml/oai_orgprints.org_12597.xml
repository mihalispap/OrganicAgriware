  <dc:description>Differences between the EU Regulation (EEC) 2092/91 and selected private as well as governmental organic standards were analysed as part of an EU-funded research project on the revision of this regulation. Most of the differences were found in the following areas: conversion, fertilising, animal feeding, veterinary treatment and animal husbandry. Many differences have specific justifications, influenced by specific national or regional circumstances or policy framework. The variations between the EU Regulation, governmental and private-sector standards do not concern basic requirements; i.e. there is a general agreement on the main general principles of organic agriculture within the EU. A certain regional flexibility can be justified.</dc:description>
