  <dc:description>Nine encoded wine samples from a German long-term field trial on the comparison of different cultivation systems were examined with the image forming methods biocrystallization, capillary dynamolysis and circular chromatography. The images of the encoded samples were i. differentiated into three groups of images with similar form expression, ii. characterised as ‘fresh – aged’ based on a catalogue of reference images, iii. ranked (according to the quality characterization) and iv. assigned to the different cultivation systems (classified). Images gained with samples from integrated farming showed more structures indicating enhanced aging compared with the samples from organic and especially from biodynamic origin. Based on these observations, a correct assignment of all encoded samples to cultivation systems was possible. These results are interpreted as indicating higher product quality of biodynamic and organic wine compared to wine from integrated farming.</dc:description>
