  <dc:description>Fungi that infect insects have received considerable attention by scientists for their potential for biological control of pests. Many research projects have focussed on the selection of virulent strains for target pests and their development as biological control agents. In contrast, surprisingly little is known about the fundamental ecology of most of these fungi in nature. This knowledge is essential in order to receive the most ecosystem services provided by entomopathogenic fungi in agricultural production. Knowledge of the basic ecology of the fungi is also necessary to include them in conservation biological control. In this biological control strategy, agricultural practices and/or habitat manipulations are applied to the farming system to favour living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests (Eilenberg et al., 2001).</dc:description>
