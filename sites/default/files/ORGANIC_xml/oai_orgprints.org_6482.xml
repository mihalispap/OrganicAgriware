  <dc:description>This case study illustrates that reversion to conventional farming does not take place due to technical problems related to production but that farmers in general decided to stop farming organically due to economic problems – primarily marketing problems – and because of changes in regulations. Almost none of the reverters wished to start using pesticides again and most of them also considered organic farming to be a professional challenge. In general, however, organic and conventional production modes were found to be very similar and furthermore the general structural development was considered inevitable – also with in organic farming. It is discussed whether the farmers’ lack of organic consumption may influence their connection to the organic farming mode.</dc:description>
