  <dc:description>Brown plant hopper showed me the way into organic farming. In 2001, I started my practice with logic of legumes just to cut down the 45 percent expenses of my paddy on fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides.  Later as I realized each and every plant carries itâ€™s own nutrients, medicinal values and characters.  Plants like millets, oil seeds, spices, di-cots, monocots and weeds all being used as a green manure.  For all my agriculture problems and crop demands, I look for the answers only through green manures and found almost.  Past from 15 years, I still grow in 15 acres with over 45 percent less inputs, 20-25 quintals of paddy yield per acre and my profit has grown 10 times in last 10 years.</dc:description>
