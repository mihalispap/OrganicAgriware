  <dc:description>The Danish market for organic foods is relatively mature, meaning that it does not suffer seriously from the supply shortages and barriers, which dominate most of the markets outside Denmark. The well-functioning Danish market makes it possible to collect and analyse reliable data on purchases. In an ongoing study we analyse consumer demand for organic foods in Denmark. The project is part of the Danish DARCOF centre and participating institutions include AKF, University of Copenhagen, GfK Denmark and CIRED, France. Our study distinguishes itself by being based on observations of stated as well as actual purchasing behaviour. The project applies information at the individual household level (utilising panel data of 2000 households’ daily purchases of a large number of organic as well as conventional foods during 1997-2001), which makes a detailed and informative approach possible. In addition, the modelling is supported by a questionnaire, surveying households in the very same panel (response rate 77%) for information on attitudes, stated values and food habits. Description of project, data and full questionnaire is available at www.akf.dk/organicfoods. In this paper, we identify important characteristics of consumers with high propensity to purchase organic foods, with special attention to the importance of valued organic product attributes.</dc:description>
