  <dc:description>Leguminous cover crops are one important source of nitrogen in organic stockless farming. Therefore the influence of six legume species in pure stands and one grass-clover mixture on grain yield and quality of the undersown winter rye and of the succeeding crop spring oat was examined. Three field trials were conducted at one experimental site in southern Bavaria (2005/06/07 until 2007/08/09; in 2005/06/07 only three of six leguminous undersowings). Additionally, after the harvest of rye two stubble seeds (clover in pure and mixed stands with vetch and mustard) and a control (rye without cover crop) were established in each year. &#xD;
The cash crop was not affected by the undersown variants with respect to grain yield and quality. However, grain yield of the subsequent oat was generally higher after cover crops compared to the control. Thereby the grain yield after black medick, white or red clover in the undersown variants was significantly higher than after the stubble seeds and after the grass-clover mixture in one and two of three years, respectively. Furthermore the crude protein content of oat was positively affected after all undersown variants in contrast to the variants stubble seed.  &#xD;
