  <dc:description>This study has a number of objectives: (i) to convert a hill and upland unit of approximately 400 ha, carrying 600 breeding ewes and 35 suckler cows, to organic production standards; (ii) to establish a smaller, comparable unit to be managed conventionally to provide a direct comparison between organic and conventional systems; (iii) to measure the physical performance of grassland and associated sheep and beef enterprises when converting to UKROFS standards for organic production; (iv) to assess the financial impact of conversion; (v) to assess the implications of conversion for animal welfare and disease control; and (vi) to undertake a programme of experiments to provide solutions in specific problem areas.</dc:description>
