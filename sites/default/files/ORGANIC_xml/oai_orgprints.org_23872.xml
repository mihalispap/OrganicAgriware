  <dc:description>Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have a track record of being antagonist to quite of a number of agricultural important pathogens. Trichoderma have some unique characteristics that make it scientifically proven and suitable bio-control agents against varieties of pathogenic organism infecting economic food crops. Trichoderma has the advantage of being environment friendly and not hazardous to the health of human beings, livestock, soil and environment. Competitive bio-assay experiment was carried out in the laboratory on the effects of Trichoderma species (T. atroviride P1 isolates, T. harzianum T22 isolates, T. viride) on some crop pathogens (Phytophthora cinnanerium, Botrytis cinaria and Rhizoctonia solani). Pure culture of Trichoderma and pathogenic fungi were replicated four times and arranged in a complete block design. The result of the experiment shows that Trichoderma species are strong competitor of P. cinnanerium, B. cinaria and R.solani. Within 72 hours, the Trichoderma species were able to grow and completely overlap the P. cinnanerium, B. cinaria and R. solani. This strong competitiveness indicated that Trichoderma species would effectively inhibit the growth of P. cinnanerium, B. cinaria and R. solani on the infected crop; thus the application of Trichoderma species in the control of P. cinnanerium, B. cinaria and R. solani infected crops.</dc:description>
