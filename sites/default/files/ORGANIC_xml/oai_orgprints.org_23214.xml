  <dc:description>Turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), a perennial rhizomatous herb has been regarded as an important spice in Asian cuisine. India is called as the “Spice bowl of the world” as it produces variety of spices with quality. Though India leads in production of turmeric, but average productivity is very low due to imbalanced and suboptimal dose of chemical fertilizers, organic manure, bio – fertilizers and micronutrients (Kandiannan and Chandragiri, 2008). Since, turmeric is a nutrient responsive crop and removes large amount of nutrients from soil, sufficient quantities of nutrients have to be applied in order to obtain sustainable yield levels (Nagarajan and Pillai, 1979). Application of organic source of nutrients (Wellgro formulations) would augment nutrient uptake, yield and economics of turmeric. Therefore, the present investigation was carried out to test the effect of organic formulations on sustainable production of turmeric.</dc:description>
