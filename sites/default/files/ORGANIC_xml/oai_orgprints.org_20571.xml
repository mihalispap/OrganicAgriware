  <dc:description>Korea has trumped the world in creating the world’s first  organic farming museum. The Namyangju Organic Museum is a surprise - and for several reasons. Firstly, it is surprisingly good. And secondly, it is surely surprising that the world’s first organic agriculture museum appears in Korea? It is a specialist museum of which Namyangju can be justly proud. The museum caters for a variety of ages, from youngsters to oldsters, and for a variety of interests, from casual, to practical, to scholarly. Screen-based techno-interactive exhibits are an obvious hit with children. The Namyangju Organic Museum was launched to coincide with the 17th IFOAM Organic World Congress  (September - October 2011), the first such event to be held in Asia.This museum can serve as a focus for the continuing uptake and proliferation of organic food and agriculture in Korea and beyond.</dc:description>
