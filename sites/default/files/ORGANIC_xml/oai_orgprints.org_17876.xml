  <dc:description>During the last 20 years the area with maize in Denmark has increased dramatically and reached 163,000 ha in 2008. Silage maize is easy to grow, is a suitable fodder for cows and goes well with grass-clover in the diet. This means that silage maize is often found in crop rotations with grass-clover on sandy soils in western Denmark. The ploughing in of grass-clover fields poses a serious risk of increased nitrate leaching on a coarse sandy soil, even when carried out in spring. With increased maize cropping, there is therefore a need for strategies to reduce nitrate leaching after ploughing of grass-clover.In the ICROFS project, OrgGrass, we examined the effect of catch crop and slurry application on nitrate leaching from maize after a spring-ploughed grass-clover.</dc:description>
