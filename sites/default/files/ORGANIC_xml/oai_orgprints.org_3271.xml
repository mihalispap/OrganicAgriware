  <dc:description>There is a growing wish for recycling of human urine and faeces, also in the Western societies. One challenge of this recycling technology is that of changing the present waste-water infrastructure and toilet technologies. Another chal-lenge is that of attaining social and cultural acceptability of the new alternatives. &#xD;
&#xD;
My PhD project – "Culture in the bathroom – a study of social and cultural hindrances and potentials for recycling of urine and faeces" – is focusing on the social and cultural challenges of this idea of recycling. The project was initiated in December 2002. In this poster I will give empirical examples of social and cultural aspects in Danish bath-rooms and discuss their influence on the possibility of recycling urine and faeces. &#xD;
&#xD;
This poster present my PhD project. It presents some common features in Danish bathrooms, some differences and also the theoretical and methodological approach in the project.</dc:description>
