  <dc:description>With this booklet I attempt to make my master thesis usable in practice. It translates my theoretical study on social learning in farmer groups into practical hands-on advices. I hope my advices will help create fruitful learning environments for existing farmer groups, for those who assist farmer groups in development, and as inspiration for new farmer groups. This booklet is a continuation of my master thesis, written in 2012: Social Learning in Farmer Groups – Field Study in the Rwenzori Region, Western Uganda. The thesis is based on four months of fieldwork, working with three Farmer Family Learning Groups (FFLG). I was assisted by Sustai-nable Agricultural Trainers Network (SATNET) and Organic Denmark (OD). It is dedicated to those who work on FFLG’s, but may be relevant for others as well.</dc:description>
