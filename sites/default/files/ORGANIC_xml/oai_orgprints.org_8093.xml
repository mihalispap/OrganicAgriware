  <dc:description>The aim is to develop an alternative calf rearing system for replacement calves that will improve animal welfare on dairy farms and meets the requirements of farmers in terms of practicality and cost. On the dairy farms that make use of a suckling system are calves suckled by their mother or a nurse cow, for a duration that ranges from three days up to three months. Compared to artificial calf rearing, suckling systems are beneficial to the welfare of calves. The calves will be nursed by their mother, suckled with milk, learn to eat roughage at a younger age, have social contact with other calves and cows and have space enough to exercise and play.</dc:description>
