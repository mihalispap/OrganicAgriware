  <dc:description>The black vine weevil (Otiorhynchus sulcatus) is a common pest in Central Europe but rather new on outdoor crops in Finland. Spreading of enthomopathogenic nematodes against weevils by drip irrigation was tested at MTT during 2003-2004. The results proved that at least in small-scale use the nematodes were easily spread through the irrigation system into the field. We were not able to prove the efficiency of the nematodes against larvae because of too low level of both species populations in the experimental cages in the field.</dc:description>
