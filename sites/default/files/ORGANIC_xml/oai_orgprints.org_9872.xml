  <dc:description>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of way of tomatoes cultivation on content of both health promoting and toxic components representing by carotenoids (lycopene, β-carotene), vitamin C and glycoalkaloids (α-tomatine, dehydrotomatine). The levels of biologically active compounds were shown to be strongly affected by the degree of maturity of fruit and varied among system with various fertilizers. Slurry, organic fertilizer with high fertilization efficiency, is good alternative to mineral fertilization. Lower content of toxic glycoalkaloids was found in tomatoes from organic and combined “low input” farming. The differences were variety depended in some extent.</dc:description>
