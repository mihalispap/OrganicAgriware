  <dc:description>The purpose of the study is to assess the importance of natural pastures as a growing environment for horses and, at the same time, to evaluate the landscape value of such pastures. Another aim is to look at possible ways of conserving areas which have been in use as horse pastures for a long period of time as traditional biotopes belonging to the Finnish horse grazing culture, and to examine how their management and care could be improved.</dc:description>
