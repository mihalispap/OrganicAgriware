  <dc:description>Sooty blotch causes heavy losses in Lake Constance organic apple production. In the last&#xD;
five years research has been done at the research station for fruit growing&#xD;
(Kompetenzzentrum Obstbau – Bodensee) on strategies to control Sooty blotch on organic&#xD;
grown pome fruit. Different control strategies with lime sulphur, coconut soap and&#xD;
potassium bicarbonate with different application rates, application times were tested in&#xD;
several trials on the cultivar ‘Topaz’. Over the years the results show that lime sulphur has&#xD;
significant effects in controlling Sooty blotch. In a first trial potassium bicarbonate showed&#xD;
a promising efficacy against Sooty blotch. Concerning the right application times we need&#xD;
further investigations. The problem is that Sooty blotch is a disease complex caused by&#xD;
several fungi and it is likely that the fungi that are a part of the complex differ from area to&#xD;
area.</dc:description>
