  <dc:description>The recent changes in organic farming practices (e.g. larger farms, simplification of crop rotations, organic farms without animal husbandry) are sometimes seen as a first indication of conventionalisation of on-farm practices. Although conventionalisation is possible, changes in organic farming also need to be seen from an evolutionary perspective: change is necessary to adapt to a changing environment. It might thus be useful to take a closer look at the changes taking place, distinguishing between first order changes, i.e. changes that do not undermine organic farmingâ€™s principles (e.g. professionalisation) and second order changes, i.e. changes that may lead organic farming onto the same development trajectory as conventional farming.</dc:description>
