  <dc:subject>Production systems</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>To maintain the integrity of organic farming systems guidelines to ensure coexistence between genetically modified (GM), conventional and organic crops should be implied. Since seed is moved cross borders a regulatory system is need to allow for organically produced seed of varieties adapted to organic production systems being available to organic farmers both in developed and developing countries.</dc:description>
