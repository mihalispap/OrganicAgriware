  <dc:title>Toholampi leaching field</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Air and water emissions</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Toholampi leaching field (owned by the MTT Agrifood Research Finland) is situated in Western Finland (63° N 24° E). The field consists of 16 plots of 0.16 hectares each. The soil type is fine sand, with five % organic C in the plough layer. There has been an experimental setup with organic and conventional crop rotations since 1997. Plots are sub-drained and water is collected separately from each plot to the observation building, where the volume of water is measured and flow-weighted water samples for analyses are taken manually. Surface water is also collected and measured.</dc:description>
