  <dc:description>Onions are known to contain high levels of flavonoids and a comparison of the efficiency, reproducibility and detection limits of various extraction methods has been made in order to develop fast and reliable analytical methods for analysis of flavonoids in onions.&#xD;
Conventional and classical methods are time- and solvent-consuming and the presence of light and oxygen during sample preparation facilitate degradation reactions. Thus, classical methods were compared with microwave (irradiation) extraction, ultrasonic liquid extraction and accelerated solvent extraction.</dc:description>
