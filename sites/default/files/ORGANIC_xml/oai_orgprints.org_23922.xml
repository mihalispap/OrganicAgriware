  <dc:description>In the past years a considerable number of farms have returned from organic to conventional production in Germany. Survey and interview results show that this change is due to a variety of personal and farm-specific as well as external factors. Here economic aspects as well as problems with the organic regulation and control system play a relatively large role. The diversity of the farm reversion constellations means that there is no central key point by which the reversion can be avoided. Instead, a mix of different measures is necessary that would lead to an improvement of the framework conditions for all organic farms.</dc:description>
