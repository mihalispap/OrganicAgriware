  <dc:description>Brassica plant species show some characteristics in their use of plant nutrients which make them different from most other crops. These characteristics often make brassicas difficult to grow in low-input systems with limited nutrient availability, but at the same time they also make some brassica species valuable tools for reducing nitrate leaching losses and improving N management in farming systems. The paper presents experimental results on brassica crops as main crops and cover crops.</dc:description>
