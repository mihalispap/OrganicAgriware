  <dc:description>This article presents the main findings of a recent survey of 307 dairy producers and 99 vegetable producers from Western France. Conventional farmers as well as organic farmers who recently switched to organic farming have been surveyed. Our results illustrate the differences between the two groups of farmers in terms of personal characteristics (age, education level, sensitivity to environmental problems) and in terms of characteristics of their farm (size, labor, soil type). Our findings also show that economic factors are the main drivers of conversion to organic farming in the vegetable sector while ideological factors and, above all, technical factors are most important in the dairy sector.</dc:description>
