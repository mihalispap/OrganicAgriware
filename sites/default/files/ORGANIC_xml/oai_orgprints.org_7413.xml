  <dc:description>In 2002-2004, the disease incidences of six potato varieties grown under organic or integrated farm practices were studied. Disease incidences were also investigated with respect to soil fungal populations and the practice of pre-germinating of tubers. Organically grown potatoes had a lower occurrence of sprout rot (Rhizoctonia solani) and common scab (Streptomyces scabies) than potatoes grown in integrated system. More saprophytic species were found in the organic rather than in the integrated system. Pre-germination of potato tubers had positive but minimal effect. There were large differences in disease susceptibility among the potato varieties tested.</dc:description>
