  <dc:description>This is the final report from Defra project OF0147&#xD;
To study the potential of organic farming in the hills and uplands, a comparison of organic and conventional production systems at similar stocking rates was made at ADAS Redesdale. This was supported by additional assessments in two further organic flocks, managed at reduced stocking rates, and by data collection on 10 commercial organic farms. Data were provided on physical and financial performance, animal health and welfare, and changes in botanical composition. Specific studies were done to quantify the potential of novel crops for parasite control, the performance of treated and untreated animal manures, and the requirement for trace element supplementation in organic hill stock. &#xD;
&#xD;
The attached main report starts with a detailed executive summary of the methods and findings.</dc:description>
