  <dc:description>The objective of this preliminary study is to assess the relative nitrate losses to be expected from organic and conventional farming systems.  The study will compare recent measurements made on organic farms (MAFF contract NT1313) with those made on conventional farms within Nitrate Sensitive Areas and, where possible, eleswhere.  The report will aim to identify the points in the rotation where differences occur, and to discuss these in the light of the whole farming system.&#xD;
&#xD;
The comparison is relevant to MAFF's nitrate and environmental policy, since if organic farming reduces nitrate losses significantly compared to conventional farming, on an area basis, it would be worth considering as an option within Nitrate Sensitive Areas or Nitrate Vulnerable Zones, and would carry the added benefit of reduction in pesticide inputs.</dc:description>
