  <dc:description>The CAP Reform agreement reached in Luxembourg on 26th June 2003 has significant implications for all producers. This factsheet concentrates on aspects of the reform package of specific interest to organic producers in Wales – for further details of the full agreement and subsequent developments, see the following websites:&#xD;
www.wales.gov.uk and http://www.europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture/index_en.htm.&#xD;
The agreement gave significant freedom to member states and regions as to how it is implemented, so the information contained in this factsheet can only be indicative of current thinking – the Welsh Assembly Government will be consulting on specific remaining implementation proposals in due course. In general, the proposals are welcome and should be helpful for the organic sector. Organic Centre Wales is participating in the Assembly’s main CAP reform steering committee as part of this process.</dc:description>
