  <dc:description>At the time for weed control, either chemical or physical, the potential yield of the crop (and thus the potential size of the yield loss due to weeds) is very uncertain, as only a minor part of the growing season has passed and the time for the major yield formation is after the weed control.&#xD;
The aim of this study was to investigate four scenarios of using sensor-based reflectance, vegetation cover- and canopy structure measurements in the early growth stages to estimate the potential yield of four pure spring barley varieties and four variety mixtures of spring barley grown in competition with weeds under two different nutrient levels in two years.</dc:description>
