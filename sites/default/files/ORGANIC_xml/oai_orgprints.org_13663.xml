  <dc:description>From June 2004 onwards a trial was conducted on a blueberry farm in the LÃ¼neburg&#xD;
Heath, Northern Germany, in which methods of mechanical soil cultivation were compared&#xD;
with mulching. The aim was to determine how far the mechanical methods and equipment&#xD;
established for soil management in viniculture and pomiculture can be adapted to&#xD;
blueberry cultivation, and can be improved. The results showed a clear advantage of the&#xD;
methods based on mulch technology in the shape of increased yields. Whilst the&#xD;
mechanical treatments provided acceptable weed control, they cannot be recommended&#xD;
for routine use at present because of strong yield reductions associated with damage to&#xD;
the shallow root system of highbush blueberry shrubs.</dc:description>
