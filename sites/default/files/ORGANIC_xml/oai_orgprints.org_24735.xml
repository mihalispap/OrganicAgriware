  <dc:description>The purpose of this article is to critically explore the widely shared assumption that trust is vital for supporting future growth of organic farming. Based on selected results of three recent research projects, the contribution investigates the concept of trust, and the relation between trust and organics in a management and in a media research perspective. Our conclusion is that neither management nor media research support the assumed direct importance of trust in organic certification logos for organic growth. The article proposes the development of interdisciplinary and contextualized understandings of trust as avenue for further research.</dc:description>
