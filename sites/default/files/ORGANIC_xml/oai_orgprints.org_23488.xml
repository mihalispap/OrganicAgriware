  <dc:description>Effect of seaweed extract "kelp 40" and phosphorous application in two pea cultivars was investigated during the growing season 2011/2012. Pea Pisium sativum L. cultivars namely "little Marvel" and "Fabreca" were cultivated and sprayed twice at 3-5 true leaf stage and after two weeks later by "kelp 40" at concentration 0, 2 and 4 ml/l. phosphorous application added after two week from germination at the levels : 0 and 160kg P205/Ha. Data revealed that the effect of "Kelp 40" was positive and correlated with the applied concentrations. Applying with "Kelp 40" increase the response of different growth parameters and yield responses. The effect of phosphorous application gave positive responses in growth and yield. Data showed that varietals differences were clear where "Little Marvel" CV. Was superior growth and yield compared to other cultivar. Data indicated that "Kelp 40" gave the better values in all parameters studied.</dc:description>
