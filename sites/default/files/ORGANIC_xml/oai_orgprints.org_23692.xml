  <dc:description>In the past years the statistical information on organic grape production has improved considerably, at least as regards to the organic grape area. Almost all European countries - mainly the governments and in some cases the private sector organisations - make data available. Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, compiles the basic data, gathers the data from the European Union member states and makes them available at its website. However, data on the production volume as well as further market data like retail sales and import and export data are still scarce. This paper presents the data for 2011, as the complete dataset for 2012 was not ready at the time of writing. At the IFOAM Organic World Congress, the latest data available then will be presented.</dc:description>
