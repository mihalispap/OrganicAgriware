  <dc:description>The objective of the study was to examine the effect of dried and ensiled sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia) against two species of gastrointestinal nematodes (Haemonchus contortus, Cooperia curticei) in lambs. Twenty-four days post experimental infection, 24 lambs were allocated to 4 equal groups. Group A and B received sainfoin silage and control silage respectively for 16 days. Groups C and D were fed on sainfoin hay or control hay for the same period. Feeds were administered ad libitum and mean refusals and live weight were regularly recorded. Individual faecal egg counts (FEC) were performed twice weekly. After the feeding period all lambs were slaughtered for post mortem investigation. The consumption of sainfoin hay was associated with a significant reduction of the adult H. contortus burden by 47 % (P &lt; 0.05) whereas no significant difference was seen when feeding sainfoin silage (49 %, P = 0.112). The C. curticei worm burden was not significantly reduced by either sainfoin hay or silage. At slaughter FEC were significantly reduced by sainfoin hay by 64 % (P &lt; 0.001) compared to the control feed. After feeding sainfoin silage FEC decreased by 48 % (P = 0.056). There was a tendency of better live weight gain in sainfoin hay fed animals compared to the control fed ones (P=0.07). These results demonstrate a nematocidal effect of a tanniferous forage legume against gastrointestinal nema¬¬todes, which was more pronounced against H. contortus. The antiparasitic effects were largely preserved when feeding sainfoin silage, suggesting this conservation procedure to be a valuable alternative to hay.</dc:description>
