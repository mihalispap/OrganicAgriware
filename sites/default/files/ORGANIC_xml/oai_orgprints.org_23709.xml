  <dc:description>The lack of access to finance for small organic producers is the cause for side-selling experiences from the organic chains into the conventional chain. This issue risks the organic agriculture movement in some have not countries. Organic producers in these contexts frequently suffer from entering into the international and national organic markets. This is also due to the lack of suitable loan services that should be provided by public and private actors.&#xD;
&#xD;
This study shows mainly the opportunities and limitations for small organic producers in Bolivia to access to loan services taking into account four study cases in this context.</dc:description>
