  <dc:subject>Soil tillage</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>In two organically cultivated field trials, located in Germany and Greece, effects of reduced primary tillage systems on root and shoot growth of cereals were investigated. The field trial in Rommersheim near Mainz, Germany, was established in 1994 by the foundation „Stiftung Ökologie und Landbau“. The Agricultural University of Athens established in 1995 a similar experiment in a field trial carried out by The Laboratory of Crop Science, located in Athens, Greece.</dc:description>
