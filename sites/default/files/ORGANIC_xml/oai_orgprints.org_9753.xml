  <dc:description>In the frame of a long-term experiment carried out in Central Italy, conventional and organic winter wheat cropping systems were compared in 2004 and 2005 to evaluate the effect of system management on wheat grain yield and quality. The organic system showed grain and straw yield about 50% lower than the conventional system. Organic grain samples resulted 20% lower in protein content and exhibited poor bread production qualities. Despite that, organic bread, did not show differences in crust thickness, crumb volume and in crumb alveolus structure in a visual evaluation. Differences were, however, appreciated by panellists who found organic bread harder and more flavourful than conventional.</dc:description>
