  <dc:description>Although it is the aim of organic farming to increase biodiversity, there is little information about the impact of organic farming on birds. From 2001 to 2003, the number of breeding birds was recorded annually on the organic experimental farm of the Institute of Organic Farming (600 ha), and on adjacent conventional and organic farms (60 ha and 40 ha) in Northern Germany. The number of skylark (Alauda arvensis) territories increased considerably after the conversion from conventional to organic farming on the premises of the Institute. Their number remained unvaried on the conventional farm. The highest density of skylark territories was found on the farm which has been under organic management for many years. The number of yellowhammer (Emberiza citronella) territories fluctuated largely in relation to the availability of field margin strips, both on conventional and organic land. During the breeding season aerial hunters (swallows and swifts) and raptors significantly preferred organic fields. Outside the breeding season, densities of raptors (in autumn and in winter), seed-eating birds (in autumn) and insect-eating birds (in autumn) were significantly higher on organic than on conventional fields.</dc:description>
