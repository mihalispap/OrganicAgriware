  <dc:description>In Germany the organic market is growing continuously and has left the niche. In 2005 it was a four billion Euro market – after the US – the second biggest of the world. The market share is 3.3 %. Nevertheless, the market will grow significantly. Annual increasing rates were between 15 and 20% and the market volume has doubled in the last six years. In 2010 a 7.5 billion Euro market is expected. Processing has a significant contribution to the increase of the market value. Today nearly any conventional food product can be substituted by an organic product. Organic products are 5 to 100 % more expensive than comparable conventional products. The total market chain is gaining by this market price. The discounter market has started to sell organic products in the previous years. This will have significant impact to the market volume and the price of organic products.</dc:description>
