  <dc:description>The study was based on data collected in 39 organic farms in 9 Polish regions. The mean share of grasslands was 47.3%, i.e. twice the country average (21%). These organic farms were classified according to the EU system of farm classification (MAFF, 1992). Among 5 general agricultural types (of 9 types defined in EU), the best economic results of the stud-ied farms were found in the general type 4 (special-ized in breeding grazing cattle) and the lowest in the general type 1 (specialized in field crops). The highest economic results among the farms of the basic types (9 of 17 EU-defined types) were reached in the type 43 (cattle in total) and the lowest result, in the type 14 (other field crops excluding cereals, oil and legume plants). Out of the classified 14 (of 50 EU) detailed types of farms, the highest gross margin was achieved in the type 412 (milk production and dairy cattle breeding in total) and the lowest – in the type 712 (various animals with the dominance of grazers, excluding dairy cattle)”. It was found that the costs of production in the organic farms were not always satisfactorily remunerated by incomes</dc:description>
