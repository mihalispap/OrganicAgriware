  <dc:description>Pepper mild mosaic virus (PMMoV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) are economically important viruses, which cause enormous losses by infecting various vegetable crops. worldwide. Various strategies based on the avoidance of sources of infection, control of vectors have been conventionally employed to minimize the losses caused by these viruses. These strategies, however have not been effective as control tools. We have found that the extracts of gallnuts from Quercus dentate and Rhus javanica strongly inhibit PMMoV and CMV infection. The gallnuts are plant excretion produced when irritants are released by the larvae of gall insects. They contain high amounts of tannic acid such as gallic acid and ellagic acid. Also the gallnut extracts are widely used in pharmaceuticals, food and feed additives, it is safe natural material which can be used in organic farming. Our results indicate that they are potent plant viruses inhibitors that maybe used to prevent the spread of viruses infections in the cultivating farm.</dc:description>
