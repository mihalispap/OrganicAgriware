  <dc:description>Accurate population and household demographic and anthropometric projections are necessary for proper economic and social planning including organic/conventional food consumption evaluations of EU27-(Candidates-Turkey/Croatia).  We must be open to rethinking on how accurately the current methods (i.e. PC, Adult Equivalent–AE) are and other estimates that represent the true nature of family/household’s gender and the age (Young and old) differences of the consumer potential of EU.  We are dealing with a contemporary, developed PAHU methodology that aims to reduce the errors (19.4 percentage units) inherent in PC projections for organic/conventional food and other commodities production and consumptions. The first aim of the developed PAHU (Copyright ©1989) is to standardize EU nations or target populations that will make them comparable.  Second aim is to create a platform that would promote a dialogue on statistical policy relevant interactive domains of consumer and consumption potential on one hand and family/household dynamics and socio-economic processes of economic development on the other hand. Application of PAHU method improves the data validation process by providing an alternative to the current “One size fits-all”– PC, accept or reject approach that I call (Gender and Age Corrected PCgac) that may play an important role in orienting innovation systems, so PCgac may better address global challenges in reevaluating real consumer and organic/conventional food consumption potential.</dc:description>
