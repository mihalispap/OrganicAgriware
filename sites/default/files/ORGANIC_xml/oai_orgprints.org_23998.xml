  <dc:description>This report is the result of the study I undertook through attending conferences, meetings with key players in the food industry, visits to a number of farms, farmers markets and other stakeholders in Europe, New Zealand and the USA along with internet research and reading relevant industry reports.&#xD;
This report shows the opportunities that Farmers Markets afford the three main stakeholders, the vendor, the customer and the community.  Where synergy exists among these stakeholders you can have a very successful market and a real alternative to the commodities market.</dc:description>
