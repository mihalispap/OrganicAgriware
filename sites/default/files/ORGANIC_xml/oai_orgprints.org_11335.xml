  <dc:description>In order to sustain consumers’ support and trust in organics in the future, it is essential to understand what motivates consumers to pay extra for organic products. Only then is it possible to design effective information campaigns and to supply products which successfully meet consumers’ expectations. The purpose of this study is to elicit the relative importance that consumers place on various organic attributes and to estimate the monetary significance of these. As an integrated part of the study, consumers’ susceptibility to new information and the effect of information on the willingness to pay (WTP) for different attributes are investigated. These objectives are realised through Choice Experiments (CE).</dc:description>
