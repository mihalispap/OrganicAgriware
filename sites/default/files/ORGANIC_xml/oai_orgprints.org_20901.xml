  <dc:description>Both interest group and public policy scholars accept that groups are important to policy formulation and implementation because they hold valuable capacities. However, the literature has not dwelt upon whether, and how, groups develop capacities. In this article we examine the question of group capacity development by focussing on the adaption of specific groups to evolving policy contexts. Taking the example of organic farm policy we look at the impact divergent policy strategies aimed at growing this infant industry sector have had on the way related industry groups have evolved in four countries. This comparative study supports our argument that policy strategy is one key force in shaping the capacities that groups develop over time.</dc:description>
