  <dc:description>The combination of organic and regional marketing might provide an opportunity to&#xD;
render small organic shops more successful again. The term regional has no legal&#xD;
regulation and consumers as well as scientists have many different understandings&#xD;
which aspects are involved with it and how to define it. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
develop sophisticated criteria for the analysis of the different conceptions consumers&#xD;
have in mind when it comes to local food. For this purpose 261 consumers in five&#xD;
organic shops located in different German areas where asked in open interviews. The&#xD;
results show that the distance between the place of production/cultivation and the&#xD;
consumers´ home is an important aspect for local organic food. But the definition of&#xD;
local food differs between Northern and Southern Germany as well as between consumers&#xD;
in cities and those in villages.</dc:description>
