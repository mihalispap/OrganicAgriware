  <dc:description>In 2001 eleven different apple scab control strategies with reduced copper use and copper substitutes were tested on an organic apple orchard near Hamburg, Germany. The strategies were tested on a six year old "Elstar" plantation. Among the different fungicides were copper sulphate, copper hydroxide, lime sulphur, sulphur, bacillus subtilis and "Biofa-Algenextrakt".&#xD;
The results show that fruit scab as well as leave scab can be fairly well controlled by a lime sulphur strategy and the copper hydroxid strategies. Bad results were produced with the different copper sulphate strategies and bacillus subtilis, insufficient results with the sulphur strategies.</dc:description>
