  <dc:description>The aim of OPTIFISH is to optimize growth and survival for organic cultured rainbow trout, the dominant fish species produced in Denmark. A minor part of the rainbow trout is produced as organic fish. Currently there is no production of organic fry, as the classification organic only can be given to fish that have been treated with antibiotics no more than twice in a lifetime.  This is hard to achieve as recurrent disease outbreaks, especially with the bacterium Flavobacterium psychrophilum, are seen during the fry stage. A further challenge known from salmon culture is that diets with high plant contents cause enteritis and injury to the intestine, which will affect the absorption of nutrients, affecting the overall health status and welfare of the fish. The result is a higher risk of disease following exposure to pathogenic microorganisms. OPTIFISH will investigate how organic diet types with varying amounts of fish and plant sources as well as with or without probiotics (lactic acid bacteria) will affect the intestine, the intestinal microbial flora and survival rates of rainbow trout following exposure to pathogens. The use of probiotics for fry are assumed to result in a higher health level. The overall result will be a sustainable production with an optimal utilization of the available organic ressources as well as the scope for the industry that they by using the optimal diet type will achieve a robust and healthy fish, something that can be achieved not only in organic but also in traditional farming. A robust and disease-free fry is the most important factor for a higher production in organic aquaculture in the future.</dc:description>
