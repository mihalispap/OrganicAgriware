  <dc:description>The import of organic products to Denmark has seen a four to five fold increase during the last seven years,&#xD;
due to a growing demand for organic products. Globally, the market for organic food and drinks has also&#xD;
more than doubled during the same period. The global organic agricultural land has concurrently expanded&#xD;
from 26 to 35 million hectares, mostly due to major conversions in Argentina, China, India, Australia, USA&#xD;
and Brazil. While Europe and North America still makes up the major markets for organic food and drink,&#xD;
the extraordinary growth in the organic markets offers export opportunities for both developed and&#xD;
developing countries. The production and export of organic products in developing countries might offer&#xD;
both economic and environmental benefits, though this has mainly been investigated in Europe and North&#xD;
America. However, long-distance trade with organic products has also given rise to a debate on the&#xD;
sustainability of this development especially with regard to global warming. Consumers of organic products&#xD;
might ask themselves what are the environmental benefits of buying organic products from e.g. South&#xD;
America or Asia as compared to conventional production and is this outweighed by the long-distance trade?&#xD;
&#xD;
The overall aim of the present PhD study was to assess the environmental impacts of selected imported&#xD;
organic products from developing countries based on impacts during both production (as compared to&#xD;
conventional) and during processing and transport to Denmark. Firstly, the global trade, development and&#xD;
overall environmental impacts of organic agriculture and food systems were investigated to form the&#xD;
foundation for the further analysis. Organic soybeans from China and orange juice from Brazil were selected&#xD;
as relevant case studies. Secondly, environmental life cycle assessments (LCA) were conducted for the case&#xD;
studies in China and Brazil focusing on comparing organic with conventional cultivation and on identifying&#xD;
environmental hotspots of the imported organic product during production, processing and transport to&#xD;
Denmark. Thirdly, LCA was evaluated as a tool for evaluating the environmental soundness of organic&#xD;
agricultural products and a new methodology on including of soil carbon sequestration in LCA was&#xD;
suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
The PhD study shows that the increasing globalization affects both conventional and organic agriculture and&#xD;
food systems. Major environmental problems with regard to agriculture and food systems are identified as&#xD;
global warming, nutrient enrichment and pollution of water resources, reductions in biodiversity and soil&#xD;
degradation. The growing global trade and development within organic food and farming systems holds a&#xD;
potential to offer economic and environmental benefits for developing countries, but at the same time holds a&#xD;
risk of increasing the environmental load from long-distance transport and of pushing organic food and&#xD;
agricultural systems toward the conventional farming model and thereby diminishing the environmental&#xD;
benefits of organic farming.&#xD;
&#xD;
The case studies in China and Brazil show that the total greenhouse gas emissions associated with imported&#xD;
organic soybeans from China is 429 kg CO2 eq. per tonne soybean, whereas imported organic orange juice&#xD;
from small-scale farmers in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil is 424 g CO2 eq. per litre orange juice. Transport accounts for&#xD;
50-60% of the total greenhouse gas emissions from the imported organic plant products. As a comparison,&#xD;
transport only account for 1-15% for imported meat products, since the greenhouse gas emissions per kg&#xD;
meat is a lot higher than for plant products. However, the actual contribution from transport is the same. The&#xD;
mode of transport is a determining factor in that truck transport has a much higher greenhouse gas emission&#xD;
per km than sea transport. Thus, sea transport from South America (reloaded to trucks in Rotterdam) is&#xD;
comparable to truck transport from Italy and France and lower than truck transport from Spain and sea&#xD;
transport from South Africa and China (also reloaded in Rotterdam) in terms of greenhouse gas emissions&#xD;
per kg imported product. It should be noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural production&#xD;
can vary (due to inputs, yields etc.) among countries and in some cases outweigh the emissions from&#xD;
transport.&#xD;
&#xD;
Comparing organic and conventional small-scale production until farm gate in the case studies, greenhouse&#xD;
gas emissions per kg organic product is found to be 60-75% of a comparable conventional production in the&#xD;
case study area. The nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) per kg organic product is 38-82% of a comparable&#xD;
conventional production whereas land use per kg organic product is 10-13% higher. Higher crop diversity is&#xD;
found on small organic compared to small conventional orange farms in Brazil, which may have a positive&#xD;
effect on biodiversity along with the absence of pesticides and the interrow vegetation. No differences are&#xD;
found in biodiversity potential in the Chinese case study except the absence of pesticides. Comparing large&#xD;
and small organic orange farms in Brazil, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication potential and copper use&#xD;
per hectare is found to be significantly lower on organic small-scale than on large-scale organic orange&#xD;
plantations.&#xD;
&#xD;
The shortcomings of LCA as a tool for evaluating environmental soundness of agricultural products,&#xD;
especially with regards to including biodiversity and soil carbon changes, are discussed. The studies in Brazil&#xD;
and China find that including estimated soil carbon changes widens the difference in greenhouse gas&#xD;
emissions per kg product between organic and conventional, but there is a need for methodological&#xD;
development on how to estimate and include this. A methodological approach to include soil carbon changes&#xD;
in LCA is suggested.</dc:description>
