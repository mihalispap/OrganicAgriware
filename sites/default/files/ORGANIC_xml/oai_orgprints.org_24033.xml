  <dc:description>The present certification process is more and more becoming focused on chain of custody and documentation. There is a necessity to go away from a bureaucratic-type of certification process to one that is takes only as much time and documentation as necessary. Two possible solutions is expanding equivalency between certification programs and developing participatory guarantee systems. This requires the collaboration between producers, certification bodies, accreditation bodies, and certification program agencies.</dc:description>
