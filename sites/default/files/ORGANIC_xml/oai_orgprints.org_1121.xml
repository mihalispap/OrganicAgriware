  <dc:description>Three years of field trials in Denmark have shown that common bunt (Tilletia tritici) is able to infect wheat in crop rotations with several intercrops between susceptible crops. This contradicts most previous literature which concluded that common bunt is a seed-borne pathogen only able to infect through the soil in cases where wheat is grown in two consecutive years. It is argued that the reason for this change in pathogenicity can be explained by a change in farming practice</dc:description>
