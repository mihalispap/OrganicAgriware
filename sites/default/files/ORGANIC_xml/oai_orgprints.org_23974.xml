  <dc:description>Organic Certification systems have been a boon and a bane for the organic agriculture movement. The stringent organic standards and certification system has mainstreamed traceability and promoted food safety to a large extent. However the inspection and certification process have become too cumbersome and very expensive for the poor farmers. These additional costs are charged on the consumer which makes organic produce even more expensive and unaffordable. Instead of considering organic products as niche commodities there is a need to rethink organic agriculture as a system that provides innumerable environmental services through good health of soil, water and safe food. Conserving the soil, water, natural resources and environment should be the responsibility of the respective governments and appropriate mechanisms should be developed for its facilitation.  A unique certification system for organic produce has been developed by Bhutan Agriculture and Food regulatory Authority (BAFRA) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests to support the organic farmers, custodians of environment. This zero-cost certification system was launched as Bhutan Organic Certification System (BOCS) which will be implemented in Bhutan to support and empower the small holder farmers.</dc:description>
