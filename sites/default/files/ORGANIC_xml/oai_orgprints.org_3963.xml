  <dc:description>Differences of susceptibility to light induced oxidation in milk with a low or high content of urate was studied. The natural urate content of the cows milk was manipulated by different feeding regimes. It was found that milk with a high content of urate was less prone to photo-induced lipid - and protein oxidation measured as the formation of lipid hydroperoxides and dityrosine, respectively. It is suggested that urate reacts directly with sensitized riboflavin and/or by reaction with singlet oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
The overall conclusion is that it is possible to improve the antioxidative capacity of milk by increasing the natural urate content through strategic feeding of the dairy cow.</dc:description>
