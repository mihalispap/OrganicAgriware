  <dc:description>The basic concept of this research is a holistic examination of the SC from the consumer to the producer focusing on the information flow. According to the existing literature, there are several indications that a paradox applies to the Greek market. More specific, on the one hand there is an indication that consumers want to buy organics but on the other hand the SC, especially at the production level, does not seem to be aware of this demand.  Hence, the general assumption is that SC stakeholders sustain the limited availability of the organic products (existing by definition from the initial stages of the organics introduction at the market) because limited availability creates high prices.</dc:description>
