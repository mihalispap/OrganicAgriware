  <dc:description>In organic and low-input dairy farming, the forage proportion of the cows´ diets is usually much higher than on conventional farms, therefore the risk of weather induced on-farm feed shortages is of greater importance. As part of the EU research project SOLID (Sustainable Organic and Low Input Dairy Systems; FP7-266367; www.solidairy.eu), a decision support system is currently being developed which will evaluate dairy farm management with regard to the risk of feed shortages. Based on input from the user, climate data from the last 50 years and a soil model, feed supply will be simulated by a crop model, and feed demand will be simulated by a herd model. These data will then be connected in a diet model, which designs diets for all groups of cows using a diet formulation routine (linear programme) that minimizes both over- and undersupply of energy and protein across all groups of cows throughout all periods of the year. By simulating the status quo and the situation originating from different management changes and evaluating the changes against the status quo, the decision support system will assist both in regard to short-term management questions as well as to long-term strategic planning. Work on the SOLID decision support system is still ongoing, and the prototype is expected to be completed in 2014.</dc:description>
