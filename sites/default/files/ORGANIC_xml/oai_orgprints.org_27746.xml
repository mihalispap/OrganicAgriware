  <dc:description>Production of organic beef from young cattle is not very developed in Denmark, in spite of a well-established organic dairy production that could deliver bull calves for use in organic beef production. Instead these calves are sold to conventional beef producers, because of low performance in organic production systems.&#xD;
The purpose of this study was to test a concept for production of organic beef based on crossbred animals from dairy cows sired with a beef breed. The results show that crossbred Limousine X Holstein bulls and heifers may be an alternative to purebred Holstein bulls in organic beef production of young cattle because of improved gain and carcass conformation, aroma and taste. However, the fatness and texture of the crossbred bulls need to be improved through changes in the production strategy, especially feeding prior to slaughter, and in the pre and post mortem handling.</dc:description>
