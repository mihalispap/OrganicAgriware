  <dc:description>This report is the first mapping of the activities and state-of-the-art on public organic food procurement for youth. The report, on the Danish activities, comes together with similar reports from Finland, Italy and Norway. These four reports will inform a comparative analysis conducted by DTU in workpackage 2 of the iPOPY project.&#xD;
The major focus of the reports is school meals and the use of and potentials for organic products in this setting. But also other important settings than schools are included. The perspectives of the reports are on the policies and the policy processes influencing the extension of organic school meals.&#xD;
The report is produced within the project “innovative Public Organic food Procurement for Youth”, iPOPY, and will be updated and revised during the project period (2007-2010).</dc:description>
