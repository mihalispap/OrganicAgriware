  <dc:description>The present work is an exploratory qualitative field study applying cultural-historical activity theory to organic vegetable farming. The methodology used consists of both ethnographic field work and systematic qualitative analyses of crop rotation planning sessions and organic inspections. &#xD;
The findings suggest that learning in organic vegetable farming is a continuous, dynamic process. What needs to be learned is partly created by the farmers and other participants. The activity theoretical concept of the object has potential for seeing both the material and the social aspects in the formation of the farming activity. By its activity theoretical interpretation of organic vegetable farming, and by offering tools for reflection, the present work contributes to understanding and discussion of development of organic farming.</dc:description>
