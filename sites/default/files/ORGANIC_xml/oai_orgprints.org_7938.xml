  <dc:description>The aims of the project were to investigate the management, agronomic and economic performance and practical feasibility of a system of strip intercropping of herbage legumes and organic vegetables in which nitrogen transfer and conservation are affected by a combination of grazing ruminant livestock and crop rotation. Aspects of management examined included crop and legume choice, strip width, grazing management, crop husbandry, and weed, pest and disease control. Measures of agronomic performance included crop productivity and quality, plant and soil nutrient balances, and weed, pest disease incidence. Economic performance was assessed using gross margin calculations. Practical feasibility was deduced from the experience of conducting the experiment, and in terms of the responses of growers presented with the idea. These aims were met by a combination of three inter-related activities: a theoretical study; a field experiment; and a financial and economic evaluation.</dc:description>
