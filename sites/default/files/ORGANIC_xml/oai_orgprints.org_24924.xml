  <dc:description>The paper will describe the business logic and management concept looking closer to the processes behind economic performance and efficiency. The analysis will be based on a literature review and on two case-study businesses of a medium-sized VBFC. The first case study business will be characterized by the quality aspects of its products and/or process and the story behind its production system. The second one will focus on the cooperation and communication between chain partners such as farmers, processors, and wholesalers. The instrument of contracts and the different types of contracts will be of particular interest.</dc:description>
