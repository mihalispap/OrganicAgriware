  <dc:description>Codling-moth and applescab are the most important pathogens in both conventional and&#xD;
organic apple productions. In order to control any phytopathological problem, it is&#xD;
important to improve the knowledge of the behaviour of each specific pest. Since several&#xD;
years (starting from 1986) we are improving in Trentino (North-Eastern Italy) the&#xD;
observations of the population dynamics of codling-moth in order to find the best way to&#xD;
control and treat this pest insect.&#xD;
Constant monitoring and the knowledge of the characteristics of the different compounds&#xD;
and possible methods to control the codling-moth (mating disruption, granulose virus and&#xD;
specific nematodes) represent the most important basis to organize an effective controlstrategy.</dc:description>
