  <dc:description>To assess the sustainability of the agricultural sectors of three farming systems of the Province of Massa (Tuscany, Italy) the analysis was performed on agro-environmental and economic aspects of 5 farms with different management systems: conventional and organic. The agro-environmental sustainability was measured through indicators of the soil, water, air and landscape-biodiversity. Economic indicators was carried out by detecting economic synthesis. The result shows that the analysed farms reach a good level of sustainability with regard to economic aspects and have positive impact on the environment in particular when managed as organic.</dc:description>
