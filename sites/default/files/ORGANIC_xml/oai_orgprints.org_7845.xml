  <dc:description>The point of departure for this paper is the observation that in spite of the public measures taken in order to increase the use of organic food in the out of home eating sector (the catering sector), there is little evidence that this sector has contributed to an overall increase in consumption of organic food. Our aim with this paper is not to discuss whether this is the case or not, but with an open mind we want to point at some factors or mechanisms that may explain the (lack of) connections between consumption of food within and outside of the home.</dc:description>
