  <dc:description>During this presentation the CoreOrganic2 project ProPIG was introduced and methods to assess animal welfare and environmental impact were presented. Furthermore some examples were given and models to relate animal welfare and environmental impact were discussed. It was concluded that selected aspects of animal welfare and environmental impact can be assessed on farm, however, it remains to discuss how to relate them to each other- a concrete hypothesis and specific, measureable outcomes are required. The high influence of management makes the variation within systems larger than across systems, allowing to identify solutions.</dc:description>
