  <dc:description>In the 2003 – 2005 years we observed the effect of three different forecrops (sugar beet, winter wheat, maize for grain) on yield height and selected qualitative characters of spring barley (Ebson variety) growing in organic farming system in the stationary field experiment, established on degraded Chernozem on loess in maize – barley growing region in south – western part of the Slovak Republic (near Piešťany city). The results showed that the statistically highest yields were obtained after sugar beet. Selected qualitative parameters of spring barley (protein content, extract, starch content, thousand grain weight) were more suitable for barley processing for malting purposes after maize for grain and winter wheat.</dc:description>
