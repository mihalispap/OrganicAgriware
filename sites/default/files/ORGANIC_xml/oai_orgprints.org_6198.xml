  <dc:description>The required area per cow depends on the use of the exercise yard. If all the cows are forced to go out at a certain time and if they are fed in there, an area between 5 and 10 m² per cow is needed. But if there is no feeding and the cows have free access to the yard only 4-5 m² per cow is needed. It is recommended to design the yard so that the area covered with soft material can be blockaded when ever it gets too wet. The design of sloping has to be very careful. The laboratory tests have shown that with filters consisting of straw, peat or woodchips it is possible to significantly lower the nutrient content of runoff waters.</dc:description>
