  <dc:description>From 36 different plants, screened for antimicrobial acitivty in a Radial Diffusion Assay, 8 were selected for further testing in meat products. The 8 different plants (black chokeberry, blackthorn, lingonberry, redcurrant, sage, summer savory, wild garlic and horseradish) were initially tested in a meat slurry test system as single antimicrobials and in different combinations of three to four plants. The 8 plants and he most effective combinations were subsequently tested in pilot-plant produced meat products. The results and the potential use of these 8 plants for preservation of meat products is discussed.</dc:description>
