  <dc:description>In organic farms, the internal carbon fluxes are of great importance. They are connected with soil fertility (humus contents, biological activity, soil structure) and the yield potential; some C pools (C fixation in humus) and C fluxes (CO2 and CH4 emissions) may affect the environment. The approach used in the described model software allows to quantify management related and site dependant C fluxes and also the resulting emissions as starting point for an inventory of emissions from farms. The software was validated on the basis of intensive investigations made in the Experimental Farm Scheyern over many years. The results corresponded well to the measured values and characterize Scheyern as a farming system of intensive ecological shaping.</dc:description>
