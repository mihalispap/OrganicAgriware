  <dc:description>In recent years different protein sources have gained importance. Crop cultivation plays an important role in meeting the demand for many of these. In order to improve the quantity and the quality of yields; we must acquire a complex ecological attitude and exercise a more rational use of natural resources. To succeed requires favourable material, technical and social circumstances. The exploitation of genetic capability – as a form of renewable resource – is a fundamental method for increasing yields. To do this we must harmonize the biological needs of the given variety, its ecological attributes, with the circumstances of its cultivation. &#xD;
Today, the soybean is one of the most important plant sources of protein and vegetable fats (Bódis and Kralovánszky 1988). In the past decade the crop area in Hungary devoted to soybeans has increased to almost 40,000 hectares. In 2012 organic cultivatation accounted for 491 hectares. Organic soy production for feedstock in organic animal husbandry is needed in Hungary as well as the rest of the EU. Current production in Hungary is just 10 % of the market demand. In Hungary the 2-2.2 t/ha average yield appears to be static for the time being (Kurnik and Szabó, 1987). The main reason for this appears to be related to variable weather conditions, most Hungarian soy production occurs under rained conditions. Unpredictable weather tests the genetic makeup of different varieties showing high amounts of variation under stressed conditions.</dc:description>
