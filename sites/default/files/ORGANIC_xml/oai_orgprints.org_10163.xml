  <dc:description>Interdisciplinary monitoring of an organic stockless farming system has been carried out over ten years on a fertile silty clay loam in the main vegetable production area of the UK. The results draw together economic outcomes with agronomy, soil science and agro-ecology. Organic management has been used at the Kirton research site since conversion of a 3.2 ha unit in 1997. There is great variability in crop yields and marketing results but overall a successful ongoing vegetable production system has been established. Soil fertility, weeds, pests and diseases have been managed successfully without imports of animal manures or green waste compost. Production costs are well controlled and marketable yields are good. However, because the site is a research farm, the actual marketing of produce was sometimes weak and caused a low farm net margin. The site contributes valuable information to the European network of long-term fi eld experiments in organic farming for this particular farming system.</dc:description>
