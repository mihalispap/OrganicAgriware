  <dc:description>Abstract: In this working paper, we document the procedure and results from the test version of the&#xD;
questionnaire. The questionnaire is designed to provide information for model estimation, in&#xD;
addition to panel data. The questionnaire was first discussed with various researchers inside and&#xD;
outside the project, then tested in focus group interviews. Ultimately, it was mailed to 400 randomly&#xD;
chosen households. Elaborating on results from test sample gave rise to re-assessment of the&#xD;
questionnaire, resulting in a new version. All changes are documented in this working paper. In&#xD;
addition, the working paper highlights main results on behaviour and attitudes of the test sample.</dc:description>
