  <dc:description>The present study revealed that higher grain and stover yield, plant height and number of leaves in maize with panchagavya, cow urine but it was comparable to recommended fertilizer treatments at higher level (200% and 300%). It can be concluded that presence of rich plant growth substances, both major and micro nutrients, beneficial microbial population in organic liquid manures help to bring rapid changes in phenotypic characteristics of plants and also improves the growth and ultimately improve the productivity of the crops. Liquid organic manure like panchagavya could be prepared locally by farming community and obtain increased yield levels. Such practices would pave way to reduce use of external inputs and increase sustainability among organic farmers in the developing countries.</dc:description>
