  <dc:description>Post-harvest non-chemical treatments consists of a large range of different approaches,&#xD;
including strengthening of the commodityâ€™s natural defence mechanisms, thermotherapy,&#xD;
application of antagonistic microorganisms and natural antimicrobial substances.&#xD;
NEX0101 is a promising antagonistic biocontrol agent containing the yeast Candida&#xD;
oleophila as the active ingredient. NEX0101 was developed by Bionext, a spin-off from the&#xD;
laboratory of Dr. H. Jijakli, and is currently evaluated for commercial use. The product&#xD;
contains a yeast strain isolated from apple fruit and was originally developed for the control&#xD;
of post-harvest diseases on apple. The antifungal effectiveness of this antagonist can be&#xD;
increased by addition of calcium salts. As the mode of action of this yeast is based on the&#xD;
colonisation of wounds, the mean targets of NEX0101 are blue mould, caused by&#xD;
Penicillium expansum, and grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea. Facing possible latent&#xD;
infections, thermotherapy by using hot water treatments could provide an advanced control&#xD;
towards lenticelrot (Gloeosporium spp.). A combination of both physical and biological&#xD;
treatment techniques could broaden the spectrum to all key pathogens on apple and pear.&#xD;
The use of NEX0101 for the control of P. expansum was examined in combination with&#xD;
calcium gluconate. According to the results the combination NEX0101 with calcium&#xD;
gluconate provides an advanced mould control towards P. expansum The best results&#xD;
were achieved using NEX0101 in combination with post-harvest dipping by thermotherapy.&#xD;
The hot water treatment alone was clearly inefficient towards wound parasite P.&#xD;
expansum, on the contrary thermotherapy stimulates the decay caused by this postharvest&#xD;
pathogen. For the future a combination of biological and physical treatments could offer a&#xD;
worthy non-chemical alternative for organic and integrated fruit growers towards fruit rot&#xD;
decay, although more research is necessary to implement these methods in practice.</dc:description>
