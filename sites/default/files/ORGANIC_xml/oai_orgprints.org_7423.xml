  <dc:description>Soil crumbs are important to soil functions. These include plant growth, and the growth of fungi and bacteria forming agents for binding and bonding of new crumbs. We have studied how commercial organic and conventional farming affect this interaction. A diverse crop rotation, including grass, and animal manure resulted in stable crumbs with a high content of biological binding and bonding agents. A cash crop rotation with the addition of only synthetic fertilizers resulted in small, stable aggregates – more like clods - with clay as binding agent. Such a soil will provide poor conditions for preparing seedbeds, because prolonged rain makes it soft and muddy while drought makes it hard as brick.</dc:description>
