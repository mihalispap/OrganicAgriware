  <dc:description>There is a strong need and demand from market actors and policy makers for data on organic agricultural markets on all levels from production to international trade to consumption. Market actors need reliable data to plan investigations and policy makers to govern (market) policy measures. However, up to now, there is hardly a country in the world in which up-to-date and valid statistical data exists that goes far beyond simple data on the number of organic farms and their organically managed area. The aim of this contribution is to analyse different strategies for building up a harmonised information system on organic markets leading to data that are comparable between different nations and allowing an overall view of the situation and development of the world market for organic products.</dc:description>
