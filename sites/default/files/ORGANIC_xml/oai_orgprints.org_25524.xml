  <dc:description>In this paper we present some findings of the SOLINSA, an EU 7th framework research project that aims to identify barriers to the development of Learning and Innovation Networks for sustainable agriculture. Applying a comparative approach in different countries and cultural contexts we address some of the challenges connected to transdisciplinary methodology. Our project takes an action research perspective where researchers diverge from the traditional role of observer and act as change agents facilitating the work of innovation networks. Our aim is to explore how members of the academic community can engage with these networks and through which processes they can have any positive impact. We will present two case studies (out of 17 in total in SOLINSA) to illustrate difficulties, key issues, good and bad practices. Through this, apart from academia, we intend to contribute to innovation and the advancement of complex systems within the European rural development arena.</dc:description>
