  <dc:description>Aspects of fair trade gain a growing relevance in the current debate on the further development and reorientation of the domestic (mid-European) organic sector. Fair trade aspects were part of the implicit self-conception since the organic movement was established. The authors would like to show up ways how these implicit ideals can be carried over into explicit standards comprehensible to the consumer. This request can be reached via liberal, restrictive or transparent fair pricing schemes.</dc:description>
