&#xD;
Feeding of livestock in organic production systems was discussed in four different groups: beef production, dairy production, pig production and poultry production.&#xD;
&#xD;
A. Beef production&#xD;
The general consensus was that most of these problems require solutions on management and systems level, rather than further nutritional research.&#xD;
Research and development needs are described.&#xD;
&#xD;
B. Dairy production&#xD;
The discussion on health and welfare related problems in dairy feeding focused on many issues.&#xD;
Some management solutions are given.&#xD;
Research and development needs are demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
C. Pig production&#xD;
Research and development needs are demonstrated.&#xD;
 &#xD;
D. Poultry production&#xD;
Potential solutions to these problems were suggested.&#xD;
Research and development needs are displayed.</dc:description>
