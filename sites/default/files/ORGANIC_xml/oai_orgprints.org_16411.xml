  <dc:description>Food business involves many ethical questions. Legislators should not leave all these questions for markets to decide. Legislators should take their role in guiding the food business, having sustainability as goal. This includes environmental and social issues. Legislators need to look ahead and focus on where the food business should go in the future. The simplest way is to guide production and consumption through taxation, making certain production, products, and diets cheaper.</dc:description>
