  <dc:description>Organic farming is a major policy priority for agriculture in Bulgaria and one of the highlights of the Common Agricultural Policy for the period 2014-2020. Regulations of organic production, and import and export of such products are clearly regulated and aligned with European requirements. Areas under organic conditions and the number of operators involved in the control system are continuously growing. In 2012, there was a significant increase in the area of organic production, reaching 40 378.77 ha. After 2009, in Bulgaria an increase in the number of organic operators and the amount of areas more than four times has been outlined. A considerable increased diversity of organically grown crops and livestock has been observed. Bulgaria has favorable opportunities for the development of organic farming and taking a well-deserved place in the still unfilled niche market of organic products in the EU and worldwide.</dc:description>
