  <dc:description>The paper examines the profitability of twelve polytunnel vegetable crops grown for an organic box scheme in Scotland. All inputs attributable to specific crops, labour in particular, were recorded during 2008 growing season and expressed in monetary values. Costs of the tunnel construction and maintenance have also been included. Based on sales data and inputs, annual net margins were calculated. Assuming the cost of labour as 7.25 £/hour only five of twelve vegetables were profitable. Results varied from 25.2 £/m2/year for cucumbers to -9.7 £/m2/year (loss) for batavian lettuce, average for all the crops was 3.38 £/m2/year. No significant difference in profitability could be ascertained between the following cultural methods: direct sown versus transplanted and under black plastic mulch versus open ground.</dc:description>
