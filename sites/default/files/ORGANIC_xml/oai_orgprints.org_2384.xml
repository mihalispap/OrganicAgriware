  <dc:description>Weed control by harrowing is an essential measure in organically grown cereals, but it is also known to be less effective against perennial weeds. Such problems might be solved by using a more effective hoeing which needs wider row spaces. On the other hand, there is a risk of low competi-tiveness in wide crop stands, particularly if mechanical control effects are unsatisfying.&#xD;
Therefore, a new approach has been investigated by using a crop design with alternating crop bands and crop-free bands. Using hoes in the crop-free band as well as a higher crop competitiveness within the crop band are two possible effects in order to make weed control more effective.</dc:description>
