  <dc:description>Resistance to anthelmintics in populations of gastrointestinal nematodes is a major concern in small ruminants. One solution&#xD;
to limit the spread of anthelmintic resistance is to apply treatments selectively by targeting the most susceptible animals within&#xD;
a flock. In dairy goats, previous studies have shown that, within a flock, goats in first lactation and those with high level of milk&#xD;
production were highly receptive to nematode infections. These results provided the rationale for targeted treatments. In dairy&#xD;
ewes, such epidemiological information on possible factors modulating the susceptibility to parasitism were still lacking. The&#xD;
objective of the current study was therefore to examine differences in the level of parasite infection and in the pathophysiological&#xD;
consequences in dairy ewes, depending on the age or on the level of milk production. In three farms, parasite egg excretion, and the&#xD;
serum concentrations of pepsinogen and inorganic phosphate were compared on one hand between primiparous and multiparous&#xD;
ewes; on the other hand, between ewes with the highest and the lowest level of milk production, within a cohort of 3â€“5-year&#xD;
old animals. Overall, the results did not indicate significant differences for both either the parasitological or pathophysiological&#xD;
measurements depending on the level of milk production. In contrast, significant differences were found according to age,&#xD;
indicating higher levels of infections in the primiparous ewes than in the multiparous ones and suggesting that this category of&#xD;
animals represents a particular parasitic risk within a flock.</dc:description>
