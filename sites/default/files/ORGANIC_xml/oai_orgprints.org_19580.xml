  <dc:description>The victims of TB have a reduced growth potential.&#xD;
In addition, victims of TB have reduced growth rate.&#xD;
The victims are likely to suffer more frequently from other health disordes than pigs with non-bitten tails.&#xD;
Tail biting was often preceded by leg disorders and followed by reduced appetite, which may be associated with reduced growth rate of victims of tail biting.&#xD;
The costs of TB were particularly heavy when medication was needed and when the fattening of the victims could not be continued as planned.&#xD;
As TB behaves like an epidemic, immediate response to tail biting is important to prevent further cases and economic damage.</dc:description>
