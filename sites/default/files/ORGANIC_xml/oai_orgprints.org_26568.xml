  <dc:description>- General high interest of farmers to participate in on-station and on-farm testing of cotton varietal lines and hybrids&#xD;
- On-station mother trials are managed by the researchers, while on-farm baby trials are managed by the farmer&#xD;
- A network of interested farmers need to be established, who are regularly trained in on-farm research and supported by extension agents&#xD;
- Farmers, researchers and extension agents together monitor the on-station and on-farm trials and evaluate cotton varieties and hybrids&#xD;
- However, the extension agents and farmers need to be introduced into plant breeding by the researcher to support and profit from decentralized participatory breeding efforts&#xD;
- Farmers are highly motivated to find new genotypes as they are in great need for good seed sources</dc:description>
