  <dc:description>This project was designed as an iterative process of describing quality profiles of “organic” and “high-quality” wheat and finding adequate, sensory-based methods to do so. Wheat growing in 1998-2000 at the DOK long-term field trial (FLIEßBACH et al. 2007, MÄDER et al. 2002) was repeatedly investigated. The ripening phase started earlier and lasted longer in treatment D2 (bio-dynamic) and was shortest in treatment K2 (conventional). Coded grain samples were examined in respect to treatment differ-ences in smell and taste. For D2 samples the author used the highest number of “sweetness” terms and the lowest number of other terms, whereas in M (conven-tional/mineral fertilizer only) grains, the highest numbers of “poorness” terms and the lowest of “sweetness” terms were used, thus showing correspondence to field obser-vations. In a sensory assay of wheat porridge with 19 persons, coded D2 samples were ranked best. If developed further, these methods could also be used as a useful and cheap additional tool in wheat selection.</dc:description>
