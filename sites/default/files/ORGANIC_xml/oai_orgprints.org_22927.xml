  <dc:description>The paper is concerned with a case of local management of eco certification. With outset in a case study, the paper explores the relation of eco certification to economy, society and culture. The paper emphasizes the multidimensional quality of local eco management of global organic agrifood systems. It takes a postmodern stance and discusses the case from the perspective of trust, responsible management, cosmopolitanization, the ‘transparent society’ and ‘green growth’ strategies. In the concluding section, the implications for the further development of a concept ‘responsible management’ are discussed and suggestions for future research are made. The paper draws on multidisciplinary research from management and business studies, intercultural and cross-cultural communication, trust research, cultural studies, philosophy and discourse studies.</dc:description>
