  <dc:description>Research results regarding organic food and farming from Europe have become easily accessible – and so can results from the rest of the world. The Open Access archive Organic Eprints (www.orgprints.org) has developed since the start in 2002 so that it now includes more than 14,000 items, has 27,000 registered users and more than 200,000 visits per month. The archive is open for all to use and registered users can deposit their research publications from refereed journals as well as non-refereed sources. Organisations, research facilities, research programmes and projects are also presented in the archive. Organic Eprints is the largest database in the world with publications about Organic Agriculture &amp; Food Systems research. It can be utilized for entering papers for conferences as seen for the Organic World Congress 2014 and 2008.</dc:description>
