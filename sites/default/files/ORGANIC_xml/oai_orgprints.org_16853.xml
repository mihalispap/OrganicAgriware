  <dc:description>The review confirms that feeding legume silage leads to higher DMI and milk production than grass. White clover is superior to red clover and red clover to lucerne in milk yield relative to intake. Milk fat content is lower on red clover than on grass diets and red clover yield milk with lower protein content than white clover and lucerne. Red clover yields milk with higher proportion of the fatty acids C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 than grass and higher content og equol than grass and white clover.</dc:description>
