  <dc:description>This paper deals with the question of the psychographic and socio-demographic factors influencing the purchase behaviour for organic food. Based on purchase data from household panels a causal model was developed and tested using the structural equation modelling method with SSI LISREL. The analysis revealed new insights about consumer behaviour regarding organic food. While the influence of the classical consumer segmentation criteria ‘income’ and ‘education’ was proven to be not significant, the purchase behaviour was primarily determined by selfish buying motives. Consumers buy organic products because they taste better, contain fewer residues and are considered to be healthier. In opposite, the influence of altruistic buying motives regarding environmental friendly behaviour was not significant. Up to now the organic market has not yet reached customers with positive attitudes towards fast food and snacks.</dc:description>
