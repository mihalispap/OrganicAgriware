  <dc:description>Experiences from Trondheim municipality confirm that it is easier to introduce organic food in schools and kindergartens when it is part of a larger environmental commitment. In Trondheim, school and kindergarten staff, as well as parents, are offered courses in healthy and sustainable eating and cooking. Purchasing organic food becomes more meaningful and motivating when it is part of a commitment for a better environment, healthier diet and a part of children’s education. When children are involved in preparing healthy meals with environmentally sound food choices, including local, organic and seasonal foods, they learn with all their senses.  Such a practical approach is useful in education for sustainable development.</dc:description>
