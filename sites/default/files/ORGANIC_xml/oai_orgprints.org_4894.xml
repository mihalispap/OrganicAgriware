  <dc:description>How can we adequately express the quality of food produced by organic agriculture? To answer this research question, we defined a concept of ‘inner quality’ (formerly called ‘vital quality’) based on the life processes growth and differentiation, and their integration. Growers use management methods to influence life processes in their crops, thus optimising the quality of the final product. Traders and consumers can recognise certain product properties as being the result of these life processes. Here, we present a course of validation for the quality concept, together with appropriate quality parameters. The process of validation has been completed in part for two experimental crops, apple and carrot. This quality concept can provide a holistic context for the interpretation of individual food quality parameters as developed by different laboratories.</dc:description>
