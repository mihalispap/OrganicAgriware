  <dc:title>Grain dryer for organic farming</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Crop health, quality, protection</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>No seed dressing substances are allowed in organic farming. Smoke dressing would be an acceptable method. Smoke dressing was practised in the old-time drying barns. In this project we imitate this old method with a modern, conventional hot air dryer. A portable heating unit fuelled with wood chips is connected to a conventional hot air dryer. The adjustments of the drying-smoking process are studied, and different fuels are tested. The wood chip heating unit is also tested as such, separate from the dryer.</dc:description>
