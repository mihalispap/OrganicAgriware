  <dc:description>The seed system has changed a lot over the past decades with the control over the seeds lying more and more in the hands of a few large companies and less in the hands of the farmers. This has affected the genetic diversity as well as the farmersâ€™ rights. Nepal is a country with a high plant diversity. There is an increase in seeds imported to the country, especially hybrid seeds, which threatens the diversity and the seed sovereignty. Organic agriculture based on the four principles of health, ecology, fairness and care can help counteract this development and increase the seed sovereignty by being a natural driver of local seed development and the development and maintenance of seed diversity.</dc:description>
