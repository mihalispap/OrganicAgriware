  <dc:description>In sensory analysis a panel of assessors evaluate a collection of samples/products with&#xD;
respect to a number of sensory characteristics. Assessments are collected in a threeway&#xD;
data matrix crossing products, attributes and assessors. The main objective of the&#xD;
experiment is to evaluate products. However, the performance of each assessor and of the&#xD;
panel as a whole is of crucial importance for a successful analysis. At this aim univariate&#xD;
analysis for each sensory attribute as well as multi-way analysis considering all directions&#xD;
of information are usually performed. The present work studies the quality of a panel&#xD;
using both methods. The basic idea is to compare results and investigate relations between&#xD;
the two different analytical approaches.</dc:description>
