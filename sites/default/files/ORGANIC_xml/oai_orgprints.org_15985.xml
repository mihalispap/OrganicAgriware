  <dc:description>Excessive use of antibiotic to treat sick animals and as food supplement to boost production leads to emergence of  resistant microbes, which when transferred to human through food chain results in infection, needing larger doses and stronger drugs.Homeopathy can offer a great advantage in avoiding the need of chemicals/antibiotics in animal farming, particularly organic ones.Unfortunately double blind clinical trials of Homeopathic drugs on animal diseases published so far, concludes that scientific proof for efficacy of homeopathy is either lacking or not statistically valid.(Vockeroth 1999,K de verdier 2003,L. Hektoen 2004). The question is how far these trials are methodologically correct, from Homeopathic view and will be discussed.</dc:description>
