  <dc:description>Organic farming became an issue in the Vara Valley, Liguria, NW Italy, during the end of the 90s. The conversion of local cattle farmers to organic, fostered development, identity, co-operation, labour and finally gave a well deserved nickname of the Organic valley (la Valle del Biologico) that attracted tourism to the area. The Bio-district Val di Vara is formally and legally recognised by the Regional Council of Liguria, by the regional law 66/2009. The law itself sets the criteria to reach the recognition as Bio-distretto. &#xD;
The share of organic farms over the total farms of the bio-district area is 22%, and it is considerably larger both of the regional share (1,9%) and the national one (2,8%). The share of Utilised Agricultural Area (UAA) of organic fams is 50 % of total farmland of the bio-district. One hectar out of two is certified organic. &#xD;
To foster rural vitality is the clear objective of the biodistrict, but also to expand its international network of relations, seeking fruitful partnerships in order to exchange experiences, and learn from good practices.</dc:description>
