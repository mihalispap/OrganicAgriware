  <dc:description>The results showed that the sow efficiency traits are generally lowly heritable. The only exceptions are buck kneed on fore legs (conformation trait), age at first farrowing and gestation length, which are moderately heritable. &#xD;
The most substantial unfavorable correlation among sow efficiency traits exists between litter size and piglet mortality. &#xD;
In general, there was a tendency for sow efficiency traits to be favorably correlated with performance traits, and unfavorably with carcass lean and fat percentages, whereas there was no clear association between sow efficiency and meat quality.</dc:description>
