  <dc:description>In this report, a number of evaluation and quality criteria for data collection and compilation methods were defined. The results of an online survey on all existing organic market data collection methods in Europe were compiled and assessed. Subsequently the quality of existing data collection and processing approaches was evaluated using the following data quality dimensions: relevance, accuracy, comparability, coherence, accessibility and clarity, and timeliness and punctuality. The quality assessment was carried out exemplary to determine some good examples of data collection and processing. These cases were chosen because they delivered a very holistic and comprehensive presentation of their approaches regarding data collection methods, analyses, quality checks, and publication.</dc:description>
