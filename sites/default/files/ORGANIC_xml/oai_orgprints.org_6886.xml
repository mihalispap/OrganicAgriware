  <dc:description>In France, postharvest decay can lead to important losses in the case of stone fruits, as for pome fruits. Many farm-research trials with natural fungicides (vegetal extracts, mineral compounds) gave no satisfying results yet, and conventional growers also face difficulties to manage diseases with resistance appearance, and inputs reduction strategy to fit consumers expectations. Postharvest treatments seem to have an interest to decrease development of decay (Monilia sp., Rhizopus sp., Penicillium sp.,...) in storage rooms. Hot water treatment offers many advantages (compared to active compounds used after harvest) that will be presented hereafter. Its use in packing houses however remains tough, since cultivar susceptibility to heat injury may vary, professional needs and constraints are often different, and because industrial offer is still limited.</dc:description>
