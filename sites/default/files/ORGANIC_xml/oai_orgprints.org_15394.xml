  <dc:description>Organic sheep production in Germany is characterised by diverse production systems. With the choice of breed, flock size and farming methods, sheep farming is feasible under a variety of conditions. The status-quo of the organic sheep sector was analysed based on German-wide surveys of organic sheep farms. This generated new information on current farm organisations and production processes. Weaknesses were identified in production and marketing of organic lamb and sheep milk. A sustainable development of organic sheep husbandry in Germany is only possible if the problems identified are addressed and improved.</dc:description>
