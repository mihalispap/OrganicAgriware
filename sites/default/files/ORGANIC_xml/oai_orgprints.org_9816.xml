  <dc:description>Formal organic agriculture in Kenya dates back to the early eighties when the first pioneer organic training institutions were established. During the same period, a few horticultural companies started growing organic vegetables for export. Initial efforts to promote organic agriculture in Kenya were made by rural development non-governmental organizations (NGOs), faith based organizations and community based organizations (CBOs). They seek to help rural farmers in addressing the issue of declining agricultural productivity (especially the degradation of soils and natural resource base), high poverty incidences, food insecurity and low incomes which pre-vented farmers from assessing high costs inputs. Currently Kenya has five major players in organic agriculture namely Kitale-based Manor House Agricultural Center, Baraka College in Molo, the Sustainable Agriculture Community Development Pro-gram in Thika, the Kenya Institute of Organic Farming (KIOF), a training center on the outskirts Kenya’s capital Nairobi, and the Association for Better Land Husbandry (ABLH), headquartered in Nairobi. The organic sector is relatively small; however, it is growing very fast, led mainly by NGOs and private sector (companies growing organic produce for export). Exports of organic products have been taking place for the last two decades, mainly with vegetables and fruits produced on large scale farms. Over the years exports have developed beyond vegetables and fruits to include other prod-ucts such as essential oils, dried herbs and spices as well as products for the cos-metic and pharmaceutical industries which are more often produced by smallholders. Currently, there are five international certifiers operating in Kenya, namely: the Soil Association (SA), EcoCert International; IMO (Institute for Market Ecology); USDA’s (United States Department of Agriculture) National Organic Programme (NOP) and Bio Suisse.</dc:description>
