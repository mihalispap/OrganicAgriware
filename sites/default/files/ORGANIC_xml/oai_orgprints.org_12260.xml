  <dc:description>The potential of a large number of species of self-reseeding annual clovers and medics as continuous ground cover in living mulch systems with cereals in southern Germany and their effect on N supply and soil properties were assessed. Adapted legume species could be identified. The competition of the legumes on rye was limited but not on wheat. Positive effects on N supply and on indicators of soil fertility could be evidenced</dc:description>
