  <dc:subject>Soil quality</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This report was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. A range of physical, biological and chemical parameters were measured in organic soil that had been managed in different ways and in a conventional control. Factors were identified that could be used to construct an index of soil quality.</dc:description>
