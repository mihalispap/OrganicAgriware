  <dc:description>Buffer zones were effective in decreasing losses of eroded soil particles, total P and particulate P in surface runoff from fields ploughed in autumn. The retention of DRP was low, the DRP loads to surface runoff might increase on BZs in winter and early spring. The grass should be cut and the swathe removed on the BZs. Innovatons, with them DRP can be retained on BZs especially in winter and spring &gt;StoP. &#xD;
On pasture and in direct drilling, the mean annual DRP load was slightly smaller on the VBZ with native scrubs and herbs compared with NBZ (p=0.05, p=0.07, respectively). There was a significant treatment x season interaction on surface runoff, TP, and DRP and almost significant on total solids (erosion), and PP.</dc:description>
