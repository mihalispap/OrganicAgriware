  <dc:description>During the years 2004-2005 the investigation of organic farms with livestock production with the questionnaire method and chemical analyses of fod-der from permanent grasslands were cared out. The structure of agriculture lands, type of livestock pro-duction, livestock density and fodders quality from grasslands were evaluated. The quality and quantity of fodders from organic farms was similar to feeds from conventional farms. Also the utilisation of grass-lands for livestock production was better on the stud-ied organic farms than on conventional farms. The high proportion of pastures suggest he proper direc-tion of grasslands utilisation and indicates better effectiveness of those lands in relation to conven-tional farms</dc:description>
