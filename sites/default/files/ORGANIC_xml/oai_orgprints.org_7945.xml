  <dc:description>Varities of six vegetable crops and potatoes were evaluated in organic situations grown in replicated field trials on UKROFS organic sites.  In most cases the results differed from those which would have been obtained in conventional trials as there was no chemical protection against pests and diseases and lower levels of available nutrients.  Organic seed was used were available and a comparison made of the performance of this against conventional undressed seed.</dc:description>
