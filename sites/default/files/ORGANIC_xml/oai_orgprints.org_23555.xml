  <dc:description>In 2001, the German Federal Government established the Federal Scheme for Organic Agriculture (BÖL). The goal was to improve the professionalism of organic farming in Germany; to support sustained growth in production of organic food; and to stimulate a corresponding growth in the market for organic food. &#xD;
The paper presents results of an evaluation carried out by an international team in 2012. Our evaluation focused in particular on all research initiated and completed in period 2003 to 2010. The overall aim of the evaluation was to assess the relevance and impact of the research in relation to the BÖL’s goals, the effectiveness of the deployment of the research funding resources, and the efficiency of programme management. Recommendations relate to continuation of this research programme and how an extended programme might be improved. These are relevant to other applied research programmes targeted at the development of specific sectors.</dc:description>
