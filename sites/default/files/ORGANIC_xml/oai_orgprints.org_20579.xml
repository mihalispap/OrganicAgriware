  <dc:description>As organic farmers are searching for new market and sale opportunities, the organic farming system may grow and process a wider range of species than the conventional farming system. Concerning wheat especially the hulled wheat species einkorn, emmer wheat and spelt wheat are in recent years of growing interest for organic farmers. Field trials were carried out at three Czech locations from 2009 to 2010 to study the performance of 4 einkorn, 8 emmer wheat and 7 spelt wheat accessions. All trials were spring sown and bread wheat variety SW Kadrilj was used as check. The results show that some accessions of the hulled wheat species are inclined to lodging. On the other hand, they are resistant to foliar diseases, e.g. powdery mildew and leaf rust. Hulls serve as barriers against Fusarium head blight infection and therewith associated DON contamination of grains. Grain yield of hulled wheats is inferior compared to common wheat. Grains are characterised by high protein contents (up to 18.1%), however, protein quality is lower so that hulled wheats are not suitable to common baking procedures. Productivity of hulled wheat crops needs to be increased in order to extend their acreage in organic farming systems. The different technological and nutritional quality of hulled wheat species offers the possibility for new food products to be launched on the market and, hence, possibilities for regional marketing.</dc:description>
