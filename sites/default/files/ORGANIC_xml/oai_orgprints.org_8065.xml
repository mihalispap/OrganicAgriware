  <dc:description>There is significant diversity in livestock production across Europe, as a consequence of a range of climatic, historic and economic factors. Yet there are common standards and goals. Enlargement of the European Union has added emphasis to the importance of this diversity. Statistics representing the recent development of organic farming illustrates the considerable variation across the continent in relation to land use and the main animal species farmed. This paper examines some of the climatic and historical impacts of a diverse Europe and recom-mends a degree of flexibility in the adoption of or-ganic standards.</dc:description>
