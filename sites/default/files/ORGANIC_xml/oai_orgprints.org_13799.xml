  <dc:description>A novel formulation of potassium bicarbonate (Armicarb) was evaluated in 2004 and 2005 as&#xD;
agent against apple scab (3 field trials) and sooty blotch (2 field trials). Armicarb controlled&#xD;
scab equally well as the reference treatments sulphur and copper. Armicarb showed also&#xD;
excellent activity against sooty blotch. However, potential side-effects such as lenticell spot&#xD;
development need further investigation. At present, potassium bicarbonate is considered by&#xD;
the Swiss registration authorities as non-toxic to humans and in consequence, no residue&#xD;
levels have been specified. Armicarb has very interesting properties as a plant protection&#xD;
agent and its composition and risk profile are expected to fulfil the IFOAM standards for&#xD;
acceptance of novel plant protection agents to a very large extent.</dc:description>
