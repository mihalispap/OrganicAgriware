  <dc:description>The African continent has experienced significant growth in the organic sector in recent years. This paper draws from in-depth interviews with fifty organic farmers across four selected countries – Egypt, Ghana, Kenya and Uganda – to document the socio-economic impacts associated with the uptake of organic farming practices. Our results demonstrate five benefits for farmers, farm families and surrounding communities arising from entry into organics: increased farm incomes; expanded marketing opportunities; empowerment of farmers; health benefits, and; sustaining environments. Our paper concludes with a series of recommendations to assist the on-going expansion of organics in Africa.</dc:description>
