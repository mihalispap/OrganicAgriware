  <dc:description>At a workshop during the 18th Organic World Congress, Istanbul October 2014, researchers from the Improve-P project discussed recycling of phosphorus (P) in organic agriculture with stakeholders from several European countries. How can we increase the use of recycled P without compromising a premium product quality? What is a long-term sustainability of organic farming? Options to treat and use permitted as well as currently non-allowed P fertilizers from urban areas were presented. In this video, Improve-P project partner Julia Cooper summarizes the main outcomes of the workshop, and workshop participants express their views on P-recycling.&#xD;
Statements were kindly given from Christopher Brock, University of Giessen; Louise Payton, Soil Association UK; Peter von Fragstein, University of Kassel; and Nicolette van der Smissen, private advisor in Greece. &#xD;
