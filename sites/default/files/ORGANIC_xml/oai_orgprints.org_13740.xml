  <dc:description>Asturias, in the North West coast of Spain, is a region with old tradition at cultivation of&#xD;
apple and its transformation to cider. The production of apple is mainly done under&#xD;
traditional uses and semi-extensive or semi-intensive system and with local cultivars.&#xD;
Thinning strategy is little practiced and the biennial bearing cycle is one of the main&#xD;
problems for the farmers. The production of apple under organic techniques in Asturias is&#xD;
still limited but increasing. Since 2005, experiments have been conducted on several&#xD;
cultivars (‘Raxao’, ‘Xuanina’ and ‘Gold-Rush’) to evaluate the effects of Potassic Soap&#xD;
(with or without olive oil) and Calcium Polysulfide as thinning products. We present here&#xD;
the first promising results of these experiments. With different concentrations of both&#xD;
products we have increased the apple production of two cultivars for the period 2006-&#xD;
2007. There were positive effects on the vegetative growth of the trees and on the quality&#xD;
of apples. In the spring 2007 we initiated new experiments with other cultivars (‘Durona de&#xD;
Tresali’, ‘Solarina’, ‘Raxao’, ‘Regona’) in order to confirm our results. The new experiments&#xD;
also include the comparison of their effects with those of commonly used chemical&#xD;
products and with those of manual thinning techniques.</dc:description>
