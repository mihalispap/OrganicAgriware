  <dc:description>This paper examines how organic food can be introduced in Norwegian schools.  The qualitative study took place in four lower secondary schools in different regions of Norway.  The pupils’ perceptions about organic food are looked at in the context of previous consumer studies on the topic of organic food.  Environmental education and nutrition education theories are used in examining and discussing education about organic food and farming.  The study found that, like with environmental education and nutrition education, integration and consistency are important elements in education about organic food.</dc:description>
