  <dc:description>This paper presents the findings of an analysis of the perceived rationales of smallholders for declining or entering organically certified coffee production, in the case Po√ßo Fundo region, Minas Gerais. Based on group interviews and questionnaires, the rationale for farmers who declined organic production were found to be avoidance of perceived risk of harvest failure associated with the process of convertion from conventional to organic coffee production. Rationales for farmers who entered organic production included non-market benefits such as environmental quality and life quality enhancement.</dc:description>
