  <dc:description>Like Brassicaeae spp., Allium spp.have biofumigation properties attributed to sulfur components, mainly three disulfides: dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dipropyl disulfide (DPDS); and diallyl disulfide (DADS), with an efficacy superior to that of DMDS. In this study, the biofumigant activity of Allium (onion and leek) by-products was investigated in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, the experimental model consisted of a host-pathogen system: cucumber-Pythium ultimum. The results of the bioassay show that cucumber plants in compost inoculated with the pathogen and containing onion or leek by-products show better vegetative growth than the control. In vivo, soil biodisinfection with onion by-products in asparagus leads to a yield intermediate between the untreated soil and the methyl bromide treatment. Another aim of the present study was to get more data about the nematicidal activity of disulfides. The activity of DMDS and DADS was evaluated on two nematode species.</dc:description>
