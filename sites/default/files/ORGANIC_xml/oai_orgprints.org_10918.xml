  <dc:description>This booklet outlines the basic principles of organic farming and explains the process of conversion, including the grants and other support that is available.  It has been produced by Organic Centre Wales, which coordinates the provision of advice and information to farmers.&#xD;
&#xD;
However, this edition of Organic Farming was published in February 2006.  The Welsh assembly Government is currently reviewing the Organic Farming Scheme and advisory support, and so some of the information in this guide is out of date.  You should discuss it with a suitably qualified advisor before proceeding.</dc:description>
