  <dc:description>In the EC at the moment only copper- and sulphur-based products are allowed to control&#xD;
a variety of diseases on different crops. However, it is well-known that these products&#xD;
also have negative side effects on beneficial organisms and the soil. For many years&#xD;
researchers have been looking for alternatives to reduce their use and /or replace them.&#xD;
Bicarbonates have been brought forward for many years. They are present in nature and&#xD;
were used in the past in organic farming. Up to now, in the EC, carbonates have not been&#xD;
included in the list of active substances, which may be used as plant protection products.&#xD;
A good chance exists that this will change in the future, which would open the possibility&#xD;
to apply for the inclusion of potassium hydrogen carbonate in Annex II B of regulation&#xD;
EEC 2091/92. Field trials carried out in 2006 and 2007 in South Tyrol evidenced an&#xD;
interesting efficacy of potassium hydrogen carbonate-based products against apple scab&#xD;
and other diseases, but also phytotoxic side effects emerged.</dc:description>
