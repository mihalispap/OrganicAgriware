  <dc:description>Grain legumes have excellent nutritional quality that makes them a staple ingredient for feeding&#xD;
ruminants, pigs and poultry. Legumes are known for their high protein content, and although&#xD;
they are low in the sulphur-containing amino acids and tryptophan, they have a high content of&#xD;
lysine; thus they are an ideal supplement to cereal-based diets and food products (Duranti &amp;&#xD;
Cius 1997).&#xD;
Legumes have many beneficial effects in human diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
There is potential and sufficient farmer interest to establish grain legume crops in the&#xD;
Nordic-Baltic region through screening imported germplasm for adaptation. There are many&#xD;
potential uses of legume seeds as functional ingredients, thus further research is needed to&#xD;
design legume-supplemented food products. In addition, it is very important to publicize&#xD;
their health benefits, to assure consumer acceptance.</dc:description>
