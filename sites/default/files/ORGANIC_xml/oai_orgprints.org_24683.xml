  <dc:description>Background and Aims: A number of different superior root and root hair traits have been proposed as important for acquisition of P, However, it remains unknown whether these traits are important to macro- and micronutrient uptake in soils with low nutrient availability. This study investigated the genotypic variations in root and root hair traits among spring wheat genotypes and examined whether and which root and root hair traits support higher uptake of macro- and micronutrients. &#xD;
Methods: Six spring wheat genotypes were grown in the soil with low nutrient availability. The root and root hair traits as well as the early uptake of macro- and micro nutrient elements were identified. &#xD;
Results: We found that there was a significant genotypic variability in root and root hair traits under low soil nutrient availability. Nutrient uptake was significantly positively and linearly correlated with both root (length and surface area) and root hair (length and density) traits. Root length, however, was a better predictor of early nutrient acquisition than root hairs. &#xD;
Conclusions: Selection and breeding for superior root and root hairs is a promising strategy to ensure efficient acquisition of both macro- and micronutrients in the early establishment of spring wheat in nutrient-limited soil and low nutrient input cropping systems.</dc:description>
