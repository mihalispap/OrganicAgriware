  <dc:description>In a two-year field experiment in the Netherlands the relation between three soil fertility strategies, additional nitrogen levels and Fusarium Head Blight in wheat are explored. There was a substantial year-effect, as could be expected. The soil fertility strategies showed differences, but were party coinciding with location. Although not consistent over the years and strategies, a significant relation was found between additional nitrogen applications around anthesis and FHB, expressed as presence of mycotoxines (DON) and Total Root Rot from the Blotter test. Higher nitrogen levels from fertilizer applications at anthesis give a higher chance on FHB, with other so far unknown factors playing a role.</dc:description>
