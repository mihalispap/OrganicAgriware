  <dc:description>The world market for edible mycorrhizal mushrooms has experienced considerable growth over the past two decades with annual production estimated to exceed 14 billion USD. The market continues to grow due to interest in the nutritional and health benefits of edible mushrooms. The size of the market for speciality mushrooms has also increased and the overall market trend has been towards fresh rather than canned product. There are a number of different cultural methods in commercial use, with a wide variety of species produced on different substrates. The aim of this project was to evaluate woodchip compost as a substrate to produce edible mushrooms. Woodchip compost appears to have potential as a growing medium but more development is necessary to make this a commercial proposition.  This report sets out these findings in more detail.</dc:description>
