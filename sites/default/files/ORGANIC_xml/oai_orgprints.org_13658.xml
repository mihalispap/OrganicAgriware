  <dc:description>Different strawberry varieties, available from organic propagation at that time were, planted&#xD;
in August 2004 and proofed about their suitability for organic cultivation, each variety was&#xD;
tested with and without biodegradable mulch film. Within the early ripening strawberry&#xD;
varieties ‘Clery’ had a middle yield and was susceptible for infections with leaf spot, losses&#xD;
of plants by Verticillium were seldom. This variety should be planted early to reach enough&#xD;
vigor in autumn. ‘Clery’ has an interesting potential in the phase of higher prices at the&#xD;
beginning strawberry season. ‘Darselect’ ripened shortly before ‘Elsanta’, the yield was&#xD;
lower, but the fruit-size bigger, so the picking could be done more quickly. ‘Elsanta’&#xD;
showed in this trial under organic conditions not too bad results, but on this area no&#xD;
strawberries had been cultivated for many years before, so the potential of soil-borne&#xD;
diseases was only low to middle.&#xD;
In the group of middle ripening varieties ‘Korona’ suffered under the hot weather in June&#xD;
2006 and reacted with heavy wilting symptoms, first of all caused by Verticillium, and with&#xD;
more leathery and small fruits. ‘Florence’ and ‘Peco’ had often sunburst (by intensive&#xD;
sunbeams). ‘St. Pierre’ had a vigor plant, middle yield and less sunburst, but should be&#xD;
picked well ripened. The late variety ‘Yamaska’ was robust, but tasted only middle good.&#xD;
The biodegradable mulch film increased in the first year the yield of the early ripening&#xD;
varieties, in the second year with a hot summer this effect disappeared. Partly snails used&#xD;
the mulch film as refuge, damages of the film also were caused by birds. The natural&#xD;
decomposition was sufficient, when the film was tilled into the soil after the second&#xD;
harvest.</dc:description>
