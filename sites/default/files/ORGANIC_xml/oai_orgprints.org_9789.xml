  <dc:description>The hygienic quality of raw edible vegetables such as lettuce may be influenced by   pathogen transfer from soil to plant, which might occur during weed control by hoeing or as splash-effects during rainfall. The hygienic quality is often discussed when farmyard manures are applied during production, as e.g. in organic farming systems. In a field experiment, the effects of weed control on pathogen transfer from soil fertilised with farmyard manure to lettuce (Lactuca sativa, var. capitata) were evaluated. First results do not confirm pathogen transfer by mechanical weeding or splash effects during rainfall.</dc:description>
