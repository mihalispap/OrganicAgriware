  <dc:description>Within the academics of development policy organic farming is often regarded as a production for the rich, due to the fact that a major part of the organic production in the South goes to the wealthy North. However, the organic sector in developing countries are generally dominated by entrepreneurs with a high knowledge on the requirements for supplying global commodity chains to the North as well as all the obstacles in the South for obtaining such a position. Rather than being viewed as a niche production for the rich. the organic sector should be regarded as a potential locomotive for agricultural development in the South.</dc:description>
