  <dc:description>Plant soil and atmosphere models are commonly used to predict crop yield and associated environmental consequences. Such models often include complex modelling of water movement, soil organic matter turnover and above ground plant growth. However, the root modelling in these models is often very simple, partly due to a limited access to experimental data. Here we propose a root model developed to describe root growth, root density and nitrogen uptake. The model focuses on annual crops, and attempts to model root growth of different crop species and row crops and its significance for nitrogen uptake from different parts of the soil volume.</dc:description>
