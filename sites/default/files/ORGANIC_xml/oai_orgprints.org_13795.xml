  <dc:description>The use of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) is a promising approach to control the cherry fruit&#xD;
fly, Rhagoletis cerasi L.. We already demonstrated the high potential of EPN to infect larvae after&#xD;
leaving the cherry for pupation in the soil in laboratory and field experiments. For practice, an application&#xD;
technique is needed, that is both, grower- and EPN friendly. We tested a tractor mounted&#xD;
spray boom for treatment under the canopy area. The achieved rate of EPN in the soil met the expectations.&#xD;
The activity of EPN in soil samples was high after application, but dropped to 60% of the&#xD;
initial activity within one week. Exact forecasting of larval drop from cherries is another major challenge.&#xD;
To obtain basic data, we recorded the phenology of infestation and larval emergence on&#xD;
trees which were not harvested. Sequential infestation on the same cherry variety was observed&#xD;
and larvae dropped from individual trees for several weeks.</dc:description>
