  <dc:description>The current positioning of organic products is based on a segmentation approach that recognises the organic market basically as a (enlarging) niche. Research conducted by the authors through various EU projects shows that the positioning of organic products cannot simply hinge on attributes/characteristics that differentiate organic products from their competitors, nor is a strategy based on benefit segmentation enough. A value/need based positioning of organic food products is proposed, based on a lateral marketing approach.</dc:description>
