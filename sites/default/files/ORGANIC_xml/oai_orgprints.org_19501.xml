  <dc:description>A wider range of stakeholders is expected to be involved in organic research. A decision‐support tool is needed  to  define  priorities  and  to  allocate  tasks  among institutions.  Based  on  research  and  management experience  in  organic  research,  the  authors  have developed  a  framework  for  experimental  and  research &#xD;
projects. The framework is based on a multi‐level approach. Each level is defined according to the directness of the innovation impact on the organic systems. The projects carried out for each level were assessed over a ten-year period.  Two  applications  are  presented: analysis  of  crop  protection  strategies  in  horticulture  and  plant breeding  programmes.  When  combined  with  four  development  models  of  organic  farming,  this multi‐level analysis appears to be promising for defining research agendas.</dc:description>
