  <dc:description>Danish wheat varieties are tested on a set of different Tilletia populations for their level of resistance. Resistance to bunt is studied by inoculating seeds artificially with different populations of bunt before sowing. 5 g of spores per kg of seeds is used, and the ”isolates” used are selected among the 50-60 different populations of bunt collected from different parts of the country. 2-3 different populations are used for inoculation the first year, and varieties showing good resistance are tested further in the following years on 3-6 new populations. The susceptible variety Herzog (up to 86% attack) and the highly resistant variety Stava (normally 0-0.2% attack) are included every year as reference. In July the number of ears with attacks of bunt is counted.</dc:description>
