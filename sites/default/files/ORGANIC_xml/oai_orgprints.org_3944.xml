  <dc:description>Infestation with Cirsium arvense in organic cropping is an increasing problem in many parts of Europe. In the present study, repeated hoeing during the first part of the growing season is suggested as a mechanical control strategy, aiming at diminishing the regenerative capacity of C. arvense. Results showed a linear relationship between the number of hoeing passes and the aboveground biomass of C. arvense in the subsequent year. However, the strong effect on the biomass of C. arvense was not followed by an increased crop yield. A low initial density of C. arvense, which did not cause any measurable yield loss, most likely explains this</dc:description>
