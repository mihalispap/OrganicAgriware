  <dc:description>The primary purpose of this review is to collate the results of research into energy use and emissions in organic farming, and to provide advisors with an analysis of the results, access to the data used and a review of the benchmarking methodologies available. The review will inform those working in the development of benchmarking tools and advising farmers on practices to improve their performance. Specifically it will:&#xD;
•Identify organic management practices to reduce energy inputs and minimise the global warming potential of the system&#xD;
•Identify appropriate auditing methodologies&#xD;
•Facilitate access to input data (energy use and emissions figures for agricultural activities) which can be used in the development of an auditing tool&#xD;
•Summarise the energy and emissions levels found in organic farming systems and comparable conventional systems.</dc:description>
