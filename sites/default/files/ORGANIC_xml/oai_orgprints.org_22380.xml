  <dc:description>A certified organic farm has been developed for research and demonstration of organic production system for low rainfall/arid areas at central research farm, Central Arid ZOne Research Institute(CAZRI), Jodhpur,Rajasthan, INDIA. Rainwater harvesting, composting,enhancing agrodiversity, preparation of bio-pesticides are being done at farm. Improvement in fauna and flora diversity, soil organic carbon and other properties have been observed. Crop resilience increased to high climatic variability/changed climte. Presently research is going on to develop e system for high value crops of arid zone i.e. cumin, psyllium, sesame and cluster bean(Guar). Almost weekly, Farmers' groups visit and get hands on training on organic system.</dc:description>
