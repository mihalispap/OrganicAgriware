  <dc:description>A marketable production characterized by stem weight, leaf area and leaf/stem ratio were measured in five cultivars of Chinese broccoli. From the results can be concluded the cultivar Hon Tsai Tai as significantly worst performing (stem weight 15,5 g, leaf/stem ratio 29 cm2.g1-) and cultivar Happy Rich as significantly best (stem weight 55 g, leaf/stem ratio 18,6 cm2.g1-). Other cultivars such as Summer Jean, Suiho and Green Lance were in between in this evaluation. Cultivar Happy Rich can be consequently recommended for summer production under organic growing conditions in the Czech Republic.</dc:description>
