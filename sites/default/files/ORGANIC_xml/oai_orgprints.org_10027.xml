  <dc:description>Low profitability is believed to be the greatest hindrance profitability is believed to be the greatest hindrance for a more extensive use of dairy breed bull calves in for a more extensive use of dairy breed bull calves in organic beef production systems organic beef production systems  Among certain consumers, there is an increasing interest Among certain consumers, there is an increasing interest for organic beef production for organic beef production  However, there is a need for reliable information about However, there is a need for reliable information about and documentation for production parameters, methods and documentation for production parameters, methods for rearing and housing, feeding strategies etc. to be able for rearing and housing, feeding strategies etc. to be able to increase the consumption of beef meat based on dairy to increase the consumption of beef meat based on dairy calves in Denmark calves in Denmark. Specifically, we believe there will be increased focus on Specifically, we believe there will be increased focus on improving animal health and welfare and product quality in improving animal health and welfare and product quality in the steer production systems the steer production systems  There will also be a wish from the society and EU to use There will also be a wish from the society and EU to use and preserve the biodiversity of the marginal grazing and preserve the biodiversity of the marginal grazing areas areas&#xD;
The project reported here arises from a larger project The project reported here arises from a larger project investigating the effects of grazing system (set investigating the effects of grazing system (set stocking vs. two stocking vs. two-paddock rotation) for steers and the paddock rotation) for steers and the use of bioactive crops (especially chicory) use of bioactive crops (especially chicory). Chicory is used because of the possible positive Chicory is used because of the possible positive influence on animal health, i.e., parasite control, meat influence on animal health, i.e., parasite control, meat quality and sensory quality of meat from both steers quality and sensory quality of meat from both steers and pigs (including CLA content, selenium and and pigs (including CLA content, selenium and antioxidative antioxidative status, drip loss and boar status, drip loss and boar taint/ taint/androstenone androstenone levels) levels).&#xD;
The overall objective of the entire project was to The overall objective of the entire project was to develop production methods/strategies that could develop production methods/strategies that could improve the quality aspects of organic meat improve the quality aspects of organic meat.</dc:description>
