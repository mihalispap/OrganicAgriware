  <dc:description>Mechanical weed control of perennial weeds in organic crop production over long post-harvest periods is incompatible with the establishment of cover crops for improving soil quality and preventing nutrient leaching. We suggest a new concept that comprises uprooting and immediate removal of vegetative propagules located within the plough layer to allow for quick re-establishment of a plant cover. A field experiment comparing the effects of conventional practices (stubble cultivation) with different combinations of rotary cultivation (1, 2 or 4 passes) and cover crops (none vs rye-vetch-mustard mixture) on Elytrigia repens rhizome removal, shoot growth and suppression of a subsequent barley crop were examined in two growing seasons. Four passes with a modified rotary cultivator where each pass was followed by rhizome removal reduced E. repens shoot growth in barley by 84 and 97%. In general, the cover crop developed poorly and did not affect barley or E. repens. Barley yield was only affected by treatments in the first season, where yield was negatively correlated with E. repens shoot biomass. The concept has potential for the control of severe E. repens infestations but future research aimed at identifying more effective smother crops and less intensive methods of rhizome removal is needed.</dc:description>
