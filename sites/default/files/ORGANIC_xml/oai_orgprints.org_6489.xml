  <dc:description>To face and better manage the development of new varieties in a society calling for more and more transparency, the French National Research Institute (INRA) has get involved in an ambitious reflexive program about the question of "impacts, acceptability and management of varietal innovations" engaging all its thematic research departments. New collaboration between social and technical sciences are promoted to produce, from exemplary case studies, generic concepts and tools to assess the different types of impact of a new variety. Breeding and management of new genetic materials adapted to organic farming conditions constitute an appropriate theme to develop such an integrated process. A pluridisciplinary research team, associating plant breeders, soil scientists, ecologists, agronomists, economists, sociologists, in close collaboration with professionals , will try to assess both the agroenvironmental and socioeconomic impacts of changes, by studying current dynamics around original durum wheat and rice cultivars adapted to organic production in different territories.</dc:description>
