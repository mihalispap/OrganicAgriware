  <dc:description>There is currently no evidence for beneficial health impacts being associated with the consumption of organic rather than conventional foods. This preliminary study was therefore aimed at using haematological parameters, white blood cell (WBC) number and splenocyte proliferation as sensitive assays to evaluate influence of the organic, low input and conventional components in the diet on ratsâ€™ immune system function. The results of a short term feeding trial with two rat generations indicates a potential effect on immune system function, which has to be confirmed by longer-term exposure studies.</dc:description>
