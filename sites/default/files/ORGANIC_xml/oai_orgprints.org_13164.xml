  <dc:description>For the data collected under the 2007 global survey, the classification system developed for the 2006 survey was used, but slightly modified. When the 2006 survey began, FiBL did not yet have a classification system, as it was not known what kind of data would be available, if any (Baraibar 2006). As the data were collected, a classification system was developed according to the kind of data received. FiBL and SOEL are planning to improve the classification system and to ultimately bring it in line with classification systems that are currently being developed for organic farming.</dc:description>
