  <dc:description>One of the most evident difference between conventional and organic farming is yield height. Differences predominantly depend on the crop species and the major drop in yield when organic farming comes in the period of conversion, lower variability feature low-input species. Combination of factors defines overall yield distinction between conventionally and organically grown crops. Even if the organic farming reaches lower yields, differences in costs and prices of products have very strong positive effect on it´s efficiency, which could be even higher when compared to conventional farming.</dc:description>
