  <dc:description>By anaerobic digestion of crops and manure it is possible to produce energy, organic fertilizers and good quality feed with a high content of amino acids. This can be one solution to solve the problems concerning the competition between food and energy crops. At the same time, the production of energy by anaerobic digestion limits the use of fossil fuels. &#xD;
In this study the productive performance of maize and grass silage in terms of biogas and CH4 yield was analysed. The variation of amino acids content of these crops and of cattle and pig manure by anaerobic digestion was studied also.</dc:description>
