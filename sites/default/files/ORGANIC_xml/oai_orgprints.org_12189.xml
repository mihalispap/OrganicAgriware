  <dc:description>During the period 1999 to 2007, numerous field trials were carried out in the Emilia Romagna region in order to test the efficacy of Cydia pomonella Granulosis Virus-based (CpGV) products in controlling codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.). The trial results demonstrate that CpGV-based products can be considered among the best larvicides currently available on the  market. Good results were achieved against I generation larvae, while applications against successive generations did not always provide satisfactory control.</dc:description>
