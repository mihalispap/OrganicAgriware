  <dc:description>This report was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. Since the late 1980s, policies to support organic farming have become widespread in Europe, in particular in the context of agri-environmental and rural development measures. Policies, originally focused on supporting conversion to and continued production, have been modified to recognise the need for the integration of marketing and information activities, in some cases delivered through national or regional action plans, examples of which are considered. The need for a strategic action plan at the European level has been identified and is under development. The outcome of this and the development of post Agenda 2000 organic farming policies to embrace an enlarged European Union is the subject of a new research programme due to begin in 2002.</dc:description>
