  <dc:description>This feasibility study looks at how community supported agriculture (CSA) can help in the development of local and sustainable food economies. It investigates community involvement in farming around the globe and in a number of established and planned CSA initiatives in England. Eleven case studies provide the basis of discussion, along with relevant policy recommendations and areas for future research. The benefits of CSA include a more secure income and higher returns for farmers. Consumers have access to fresh food from an accountable source with an opportunity to reconnect with the land and influence the landscape they live in. CSA delivers environmental benefits of fewer food&#xD;
miles, less packaging and ecologically sensitive farming and sees the return of local distinctiveness and regional food production with higher employment, more local processing, local consumption and circulation of money in the community enhancing local economies.</dc:description>
