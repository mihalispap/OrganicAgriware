  <dc:description>Sixteen pigs (eight entire males and eight females) were given individually two diets, control and control added 25% chopped chicory roots for 2 months before slaughter. Samples were taken from the contents in colon and rectum and subjected to GC-MS analysis for amount of odour impact compounds. The compounds 2-pentanone, ethylbutyrate,&#xD;
propylpropionate, butyric acid, ethyl-2-methylbutyrate, p-cresol, indole and skatole showed a significant difference between the two treatments. The esters, which have relatively pleasant, often fruity odours, increased in the chicory treatment, whereas the malodorous compounds, p-cresol, indole and skatole decreased in the chicory treatment. The measured amounts of compounds were corrected for their odour thresholds as different compounds can have widely different odour thresholds. Principal components analysis was then used to analyse the raw and corrected data results. p-Cresol was the most malodorous compound and together with skatole and indole count as the most malodorous compounds in the colon and rectum cotents. However, butyric acid also had some minor influence. Feeding chicory roots decreased significantly the concentrations of these malodorous compounds, especially if the lowest odour threshold values are used as correction factors.</dc:description>
