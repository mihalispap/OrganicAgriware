  <dc:description>Insect trapping: a field experiment with rotating tow-nets and yellow sticky papers was done. Insects and all relevant meteorological data including weather radar and satellite data was collected. All the catches were photographed, identifyid and stored. Yellow sticky papers: sticky papers were located in a circle of about 20-60 kilometers from the polarimetric radar in Kumpula. Papers were examined whenever FMI predicted a migration was on its way.&#xD;
Lygus bugs, flea beetles and bird-cherry aphids were the most common insects on traps in May.&#xD;
Lygus bugs and flea bettles were probably domestic and bird-cherry aphids migrated.</dc:description>
