Buffer strips and catch crops: cosmetic or beneficial?&#xD;
In most countries sufficient knowledge of catch crops has been acquired by farmers to apply them as a basic element of "Good Agricultural Practice". Buffer strips seem less known and applied. Various contributions point at adverse effects, such as increase in N leaching on buffered fields, overloading of buffer capacity and increase in denitrification. Hence, a major question to be discussed is how buffer strips should be designed and managed to achieve the desired effects whilst avoiding or minimising adverse effects? Another question is to what extent buffer strips should be accompanied by other measures, such as catch crop cultivation.&#xD;
