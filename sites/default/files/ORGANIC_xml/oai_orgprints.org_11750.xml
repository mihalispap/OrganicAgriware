  <dc:description>In organic farming potato late blight still is an unsolved problem. Up to now copper fungicides are the only way to control this disease. Delaying the start of the epidemic reduces the need for fungicide usage throughout the growing season. In order to postpone the beginning of the blight epidemic as well as the start of spraying primary stem infections shall be reduced by a copper seed treatment. In field trials these treatments not only reduced primary stem infection but also decreased the number of infected daughter tubers.</dc:description>
