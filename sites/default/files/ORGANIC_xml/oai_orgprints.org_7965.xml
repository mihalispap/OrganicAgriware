  <dc:subject>Production systems</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Until now commercial genetically modified (GM) crops – soy, corn, canola and cotton - and their products have not been successfully segregated from organic or conventional non-GM production systems. Where GM crops are grown, GM contamination may be inevitable. However, physical and legal control measures imposed before the introduction of GM crops may help protect organic standards, supply chain integrity, certification and client confidence, but this is not yet fully tested. IFOAM’s approach to its present position on GM crops may not be sustainable long term as several invasive technologies – GM organisms (especially pharma crops, animals and micro-organisms), nanoparticles, and food irradiation – all challenge organic standards and integrity</dc:description>
