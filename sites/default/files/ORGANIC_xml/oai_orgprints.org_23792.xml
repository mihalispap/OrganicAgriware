  <dc:description>The yield formation of the used varieties (Annabelle, Anuschka, Belana, Princess, Ditta, Allians) are closely related to their maturity groups. Some variety differences within the maturity groups do exist. Is the development of yield satisfying after a terminated harvest (a date between the 75. and 80. days after planting is suggested) and no more yield formation is expected then it is not necessary to spray some supplements against Late Blight. In case of an expected yield development the medium early varieties like Ditta or Allians are showing, it might be necessary to keep these plants healthy and decide to spray permitted supplements because their tuber bulking is later then the other chosen varieties.</dc:description>
