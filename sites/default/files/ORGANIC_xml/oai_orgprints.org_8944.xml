  <dc:description>In 2002, the kitchen at St Olav´s Hospital joined the national pilot scheme ‘Organic food in hospitals´, run by the research institute Bioforsk. A hospital consumer survey revealed that people were not satisfied with the potatoes that were served at the hospital. We decided to investigate whether introducing organic potatoes could be a means to improve potato quality and patient satisfaction.</dc:description>
