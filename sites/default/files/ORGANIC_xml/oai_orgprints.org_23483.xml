  <dc:description>An experiment was conducted to study the effect of seed treatment,Panchagavya application and organic farming systems on growth and yield of Maize. grain yield of maize varied significantly due to different organic farming systems, seed treatment and panchagavya spray.Maximum grain yield of 19.3 q per ha was recorded in organic farming system II and minimum maize grain yield was recorded in system I (17.1q/ha).The grain yield of 19.6 q per ha and 16.90 q per ha was recorded with panchagavya(3%)and with out panchagavya spray respectively.Maximum yield of 19.90 q per ha was recorded in seed treatment with Panchagavya followed by beejamrutha(17.99q/ha) and minimum grain yield of 16.90q per ha was recorded in control.higher microbial population was observed in organic farming system II (Non Palekar's) as compared to  organic farming system I. Panchagavya spray and Panchagavya seed treatment showed  higher rhizosphere microbial population followed by with Panchagavya and beejamrutha seed treatment, Lower microbial population was observed in Panchagavya spray and with out seed treatment.</dc:description>
