  <dc:description>Three family farms producing organic eggs with 5,000, 250 and 100 birds, of the species Gallus gallus domesticus, have been studied. The farms are located in southern Brazil. The study was aimed at evaluating aspects of animal welfare and biosafety due to the increasing importance that these issues are taking on in the society today. The farms with fewer animals (250 and 100) showed better results, as far as animal welfare is concerned, than that property with 5,000 chickens, but the three farms showed medium to low level of biosecurity</dc:description>
