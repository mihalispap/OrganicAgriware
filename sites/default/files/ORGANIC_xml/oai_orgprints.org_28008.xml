  <dc:description>This report summarises the integrated findings of feedings strategies for organic pigs and poultry, based on 100 % organic feed, which are economic viable, support animal health and welfare and tend to reduce the environmental impact of the production (D6.1 and D6.2). The report is based on the findings about technical-biological relationships as presented in the Synthesis Report of ICOPP (Smith et al 2015). This is not further referred to in the report. Where other information is used references are given.</dc:description>
