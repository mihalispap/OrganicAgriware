  <dc:description>Dubai is a city on the desert's edge. With an annual rainfall of 88 mm pa it is a city in perpetual drought. One consequence is that it imports nearly all of its food. Nils El Accad is the CEO of the region's largest organic retailer - Organic Foods and Cafe. It is a business with three organic supermarkets together with wholesale distribution in the region. Nils El Accad shares with John Paull his experiences and vision, and his enthusiasm for bio-dynamics which he regards as the "gold standard" for organics. Nils imports bio-dynamic produce from Egypt, South Africa and New Zealand, and certified organic food is sourced more widely.</dc:description>
