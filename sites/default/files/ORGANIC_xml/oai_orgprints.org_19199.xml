  <dc:description>While breeding for organic farming it is necessary to identify the most appropriate growing&#xD;
conditions in which to perform the selection process. Soil fertility, crop management, yield level&#xD;
and other factors may vary very much between each organic farm, and between organic farms and&#xD;
research institutions where the selection is usually performed. Since plant breeding requires&#xD;
considerable input of resources and the market for organic varieties is limited, it is essential to find&#xD;
the most appropriate selection conditions that will provide acceptable varieties for organic farms.&#xD;
Spring barley breeding lines selected from two cross combinations (Primus/Idumeja and&#xD;
Anni/Dziugiai) at two distinctive organic and two conventional locations were used in the study.&#xD;
The organic location 1 was situated in a research field of the plant breeding institute (with green&#xD;
manure as fertilizer), the organic location 2 included an organic farmerâ€™s field (with stable manure&#xD;
as fertilizer), the conventional location 1 was located in a barley breeding field (with medium level&#xD;
of mineral fertilizer input) and the conventional location 2 in a seed production field of the&#xD;
institute (with high mineral fertilizer input). Selection of the breeding lines was done under the&#xD;
respective growing conditions starting from F3 generation. Most appropriate lines for growing in&#xD;
organic farming were selected at all 4 environments. Selected breeding lines were evaluated in F5&#xD;
(n=20-23 per cross combination, without replications) and F6 generations (n=10 per cross&#xD;
combination, 3 replications). Correlations between barley traits and the environments and cross&#xD;
combinations will be compared in the presentation. The analysis of the correlation between grain&#xD;
yield and observed plant traits of F5 lines indicated that tendencies between the lines obtained&#xD;
from both cross combinations as well as between the environments were dissimilar in most of the&#xD;
cases. Soil shading (evaluated at early stem elongation stage) correlated positively with grain yield&#xD;
in all cases; the correlation was always significant for lines from the cross Primus/Idumeja, but&#xD;
only at the conventional location 2 for Anni/Dziugiai lines (p&lt;0.05). A significant positive&#xD;
correlation between grain yield and plant development speed at tillering stage as well as between&#xD;
yield and plant height at the beginning of stem elongation was found for Primus/Idumeja lines at&#xD;
both organic locations and at the conventional location 1 (p&lt;0.05). Plant height before harvest&#xD;
did not correlate significantly with yield under organic conditions which is in contradiction with&#xD;
some other studies. There was a tendency for planophyle growth habit to correlate positively with&#xD;
yield under organic and conventional conditions for lines from both cross combinations. The&#xD;
analysis of correlation of the F6 lines will be included in the presentation. This study was&#xD;
performed with financial support of EEA grant EEZ08AP-27and European Social Fund co-financed&#xD;
project 2009/0218/1DP/1.1.1.2.0/09/APIA/VIAA/099.</dc:description>
