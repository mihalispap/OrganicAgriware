  <dc:title>Northern berries are superfruits - how to increase consumption and appreciation?</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Food security, food quality and human health</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Health effects of Northern berries have been studied intensively already for years.&#xD;
Different berries show different health effects. Beneficial effects have been found in&#xD;
weight management, glucose metabolism, liver and eye health, immune function,&#xD;
oxidative metabolism (cancer prevention) and lipid metabolism. However, results of&#xD;
different studies are unanimous due to differences in test materials (whole berries /&#xD;
different berry fractions) and methods (in vitro studies, cell studies, animal studies,&#xD;
clinical studies). Especially human studies are still rare.</dc:description>
