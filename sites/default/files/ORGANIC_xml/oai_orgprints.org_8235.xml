  <dc:description>Novel organic fungicides and elicitors against downy mildew on grapevines were evaluated on grapevine seedlings in a series of indoor screening experiments under controlled conditions and, if they have shown a good efficacy indoors, in a screening vineyard under field conditions. &#xD;
From 39 products tested under controlled conditions 10 were further examined under field conditions.&#xD;
All of the new products tested under field conditions showed at least partial efficacy. However, the efficacy was not good enough to protect grapevine plants sufficiently from downy mildew. For a complete re-placement of copper in plant protection against downy mildew on grapevine in organic agriculture, additional new products are needed.</dc:description>
