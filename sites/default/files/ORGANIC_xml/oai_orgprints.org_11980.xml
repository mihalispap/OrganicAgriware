  <dc:description>A field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of tillage technique (GPS-controlled traffic system and traditional tillage) and level of fertilization (farmersâ€™ practice or phosphate equilibrium) on yield, soil structure and nitrogen use efficiency. Manure inputs could be seriously reduced without yields being diminished during the first three years of the intensive crop rotation. Results suggest that an improved soil structure under GPS-controlled precision tillage enhances nitrogen use efficiency.</dc:description>
