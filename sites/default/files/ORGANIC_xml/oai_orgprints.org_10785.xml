  <dc:description>This factsheet provides information on Machinery Rings; ‘not for profit’ co-operative societies of farmers and agricultural businesses who have the common aim of reducing machinery and labour costs. Supplier members benefit by spreading their machinery costs over a larger area; other members are able to reduce their capital investments in labour and machinery while at the same time having access to modern machinery when they need it. Machinery Rings provide the logistical and administrative structure to empower co-operation. They also act as an information hub and a signposting centre between members.</dc:description>
