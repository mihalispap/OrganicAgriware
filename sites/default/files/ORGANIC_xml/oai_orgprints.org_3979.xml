  <dc:description>In several standards, guidelines and publications, organic food processing is strongly associated with "minimal processing" and "careful processing". The term "minimal processing" is nowadays often used in the general food processing industry and described in literature. The term "careful processing" is used more specifically within organic food processing but is not yet clearly defined. The concept of carefulness seems to fit very well with the processing of organic foods, especially if it is reflected in a broader sense. Although there is no clear common definition of the concept of "careful processing", "care" is an essential value in organic food production encompassing care for the product, the environment and the people.</dc:description>
