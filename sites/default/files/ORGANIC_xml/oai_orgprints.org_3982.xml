  <dc:description>The processing of meat products is regulated by a wide range of different national standards and regulations. Some countries have very strict regulations on additives for organic meat products. Standard setting often involves a balance between maintaining the purity and integrity of the organic system and ensuring that certain quality demands are met. Especially for meat this dilemma has been clearly recognized. &#xD;
&#xD;
Currently the most urgent challenge for the organic meat sector is to offer products with a high microbiological quality and safety without using critical additives like colouring agents or nitrite. The search for alternatives and alternative approaches to the use of nitrite in processed meat should be continued. Furthermore the discussion about security should be connected to entire life cycles of the products, including for instance appropriate storage temperatures and cooling requirements in retail shops.</dc:description>
