  <dc:description>In the analyses of growing retail bargain power the organic vegetable chain in Denmark has been used as a case study focusing on two commodities: organic carrots and organic iceberg salads. These two were chosen to see if the differences in the length of durability between the two commodities would have an impact on the way contracts were made between producers and retailers/supermarkets. &#xD;
Both commodities, however, were bargained on a similar basis which is covered by the main outline given in this paper.</dc:description>
