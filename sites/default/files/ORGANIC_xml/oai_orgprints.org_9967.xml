  <dc:title>The potential impact of set-aside and other farming financial aids on the conversion to organic farming systems in the UK</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Farm economics</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>This desk study will consider the financial schemes available for different farming systems in England and Wales, the opportunities for using them in a planned conversion process and the financial consequences of doing so.  The results will be considered in terms of possible promotional initiatives to make farmers more aware of the total financial aid that is possible during the conversion process.</dc:description>
