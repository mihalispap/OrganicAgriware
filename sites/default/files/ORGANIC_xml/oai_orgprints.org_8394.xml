  <dc:description>The multifunctional agriculture is increasingly been emphasized as the direction for farming systems. This notion embraces not only the supply of food and fibre, but also the provision of public goods, which include elements such as landscape, biodiversity, water resources, carbon sequestration, and energy supply. Organic farming has from the onset been concerned not only with the supply of safe and healthy food, but also with maintaining a healthy environment. However, not all practices in organic farming will necessarily contribute towards maximising the contributions to public goods. There is therefore need for research to uncover the effects of organic farming practices on ecosystems and to develop management practices for the benefit not only of crop and livestock production, but also for the wider range of public goods.</dc:description>
