  <dc:description>Why are some green industries promoted less than others by political decision-makers? I try to solve this empirical puzzle by comparing the wind turbine industry (as a strongly promoted green industry) to organic farming (as a less promoted green industry) at the EU level. I argue, from a public choice approach, that one possible reason why the wind turbine industry has experienced more political benevolence than organic farming could be due to group size advantages at the meso level. If organic farming succeed in overcoming the collective action problem at the EU level,&#xD;
it will probably benefit the individual organic farmer significantly in the form of more restrictive objectives at the EU level for organic products.</dc:description>
