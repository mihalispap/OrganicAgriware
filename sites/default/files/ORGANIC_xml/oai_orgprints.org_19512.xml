  <dc:description>It is easy to imagine that Rudolf Steiner (1861­‐1925) would be delighted with the new exhibition 'Kosmos Rudolf Steiner' at Stuttgart's modernistic Kunstmuseum. Kosmos is a major retrospective exhibition of Steiner's life and ideas. Kosmos appears 150 years after Steiner's birth, and this is a timely anniversary to present the manand his ideas, fresh to a new audience. Kosmos Rudolf Steiner is, first and foremost, a celebration of a life lived with intensity, purpose and zest. Visitors may be drawn by curiosity, and others will be drawn by familiarity. Whether it was art, agriculture, architecture or anthroposophy, whether education or eurythmy, furniture or well-­‐being, Steiner touched it, and his touch has endured. After Stuttgart, the exhibition moves to Vitra Design Museum, Weil am Rhein, Germany, 15 October 2011 to 1 May 2012. It is in Germany but it is just a 10 km drive from Basel in Switzerland. Further venues are planned.</dc:description>
