  <dc:description>In 2006 imports of Organic coffee from most origins showed a considerable increase – likely the greatest of the decade so far - while premiums declined only slightly from healthy 2005 levels. Double and even triple certified coffees are becoming more common as other certified coffees also showed strong growth. Projections for 2007 indicate continued growth – likely into double digits – but much more moderate than in 2006. Having realistic data and trends is important for both coffee farmers and policymakers in producing countries to help determine their strategies and investments. Although the US is the world's single largest market for Organic coffees, there is no formal tracking of organic imports. This annual survey is conducted independently with the cooperation of nearly all of the industry’s significant importers and is provided as a public service (at no cost) for developing country producers.</dc:description>
