  <dc:description>Chokeberries were processed into jams by mixing them with sucrose, water, pectin and citric acid and then boiled. Two different boiling times(5 min and 15 min) were tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
The phenolic compounds in chokeberries were quite stable during the jam making and 70-75 % of the total phenols were recovered from the processed jams.</dc:description>
