  <dc:description>Despite the high demand for sound data on the agronomic, ecological and economic performance of organic agriculture in developing countries, systematic comparison of organic and conventional farming systems has not so far been carried out. The Research Institute of Organic Farming (FiBL), together with its partners, is presently establishing long-term comparisons of farming systems in a semi-arid area in India where cotton is produced for the export market. The key element is an agronomic trial with replicate of treatments. The trial is complemented by on-farm participatory technology development activities component and validation trials.</dc:description>
