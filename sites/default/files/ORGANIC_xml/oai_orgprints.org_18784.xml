  <dc:description>To evaluate the state of the art of organic certification in out-of-home catering, a survey was carried&#xD;
out among relevant stakeholders in several European countries. The Council Regulation (EC) No&#xD;
834/2007 about organic production specifically excludes what is called mass catering. Hence, a range&#xD;
of diverging systems for certification of organic catering and restaurants have been developed. This&#xD;
study presents opinions about a potential EU-wide harmonisation of an organic certification scheme&#xD;
for mass catering from relevant stakeholders. Certification bodies and other public authorities as well&#xD;
as stakeholders close to the catering practice were generally positive towards the idea of a&#xD;
harmonisation process. Several stakeholders should be involved in such a process, and organic&#xD;
associations and certification bodies were considered likely to be the strongest drivers. The study&#xD;
demonstrates that even the experts are sometimes unsure about details in this part of organic&#xD;
certification. This illustrates the complexity of this field.</dc:description>
