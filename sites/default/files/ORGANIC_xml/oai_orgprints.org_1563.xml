  <dc:description>Long term selection of laying hens for production in cage systems could have resulted in a poor adaptation to other rearing systems. One of the problems with the poor adaptation is feather pecking. The objective of the present study was to investigate genetic variation in feather pecking behaviour and genetic improvement on this trait by selection using an appropriate data-transformation and an animal model. &#xD;
Conclusions&#xD;
Large phenotypic variation for feather pecking behaviour. &#xD;
No full-sib group effect can be found, indicating that maternal effect is negligible.&#xD;
Moderate or low heritability.&#xD;
Genetic improvement on feather pecking by selection is effective.</dc:description>
