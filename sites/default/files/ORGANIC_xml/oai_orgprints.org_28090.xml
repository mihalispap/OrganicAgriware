  <dc:description>The derogation from the EU Organic Regulatory Board to allow organic pig and poultry producers to include up to 5% non-organic feed within their rations was due to finish at the end of December 2014. This has now been extended to 31 December 2017 when it will become compulsory under EU Regulations (EC) no 889/2008 to provide all organic livestock with feed derived from organic origin. A further requirement of the regulation is that at least 20% of the feed should originate from the farm unit or if this is not possible from the same region. The organic regulations also dictate that roughage, fresh or dried fodder, or silage be added to the daily ration for poultry. In addition, poultry must be given access to pasture to complement their dietary requirements and express natural behaviours. This guide investigates the role that ranging and forage feeding can play in contributing to fulfilling nutritional requirements of poultry.</dc:description>
