  <dc:description>A comprehensive range of investigations carried out between 2010 and 2012 provided information on the state of organic seeds in France. Results fit with the hypothesis that the market is a significant factor influencing the choice of seeds and cultivars (local cultivars, landraces, modern cultivars). Expectations and practices of producers selling on a local market (i.e., direct sale) differ radically from those of producers selling to long food supply chains.&#xD;
This study showed that the availability and use of organic seeds have significantly improved over the last three years. A vast majority of organic producers willingly use organic seeds, with, on average, 45-70 % (cereals), and 75%-100 % (vegetables) of organic seeds being planted on farms. However, the total number of derogations remained quite high: there is still space for improvement in organic seed use and supply in France. Several limiting factors and levers were identified during the study, as well as farmersâ€™ expectations for the future on cereals, forage crops and vegetables. This study described an action plan, which must be carefully implemented. The organic sector depends on the development of a wide and adapted range of organic seeds.</dc:description>
