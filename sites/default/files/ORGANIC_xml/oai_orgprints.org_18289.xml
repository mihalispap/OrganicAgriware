  <dc:description>Currants (Ribes spp.) are the second largest group of cultivated berries in Europe with&#xD;
an annual output of fresh berries over 700,000 tons. The major countries of currant&#xD;
cultivation include Nordic countries, Poland, Germany, France, Russia and the United&#xD;
Kingdom with different cultivars, growth environments, and cultivating techniques&#xD;
among these countries. Fruits of currants have been shown to have a wide range of&#xD;
beneficial effects on human health. The sensory properties and health effects are of&#xD;
crucial importance for the industrial utilisation of the berries. Genotypes and growth&#xD;
environments play an important role in modifying the composition of the berries that&#xD;
directly defines the nutritional and sensory qualities of the fruits.</dc:description>
