  <dc:description>Winter oilseed rape was cultivated in monoculture or in combination with turnip rape as trap crop sown in trap strip. Preventative microbiological treatments for diseases control in winter oilseed rape were tested using Trichoderma asperellum and product based on effective microorganisms. Microorganisms were effective to protect of oilseed rape and allowed to obtain higher yield comparing to untreated plants. No effect of turnip rape as trap crop stripe on infestation by insect pest was observed. There was no statistically significant influence of presence B. rapa on total yield. Statistically higher percentage of infected pods collected from area with turnip rape compared to monoculture area was noted.</dc:description>
