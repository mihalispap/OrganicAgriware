  <dc:description>The Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS)&#xD;
This scheme is a temporary funding source (2002 – 2007/2008) especially to support the whole organic farming sector (incl. research) in Germany. In the summer of 2001, the Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture commissioned a project team comprised of representatives from associations and science and headed by the Federal Agricultural Research Centre to develop a proposal for a package of measures to foster organic farming in Germany. A hearing of representatives from trade and industry, associations, consultancy, science and administration laid the foundation for the team's work. Based on this work, the Federal Minister of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture Renate Künast decided to incorporate the proposed measures into the Federal Organic Farming Scheme (FOFS) to translate them into practice. This scheme supplements existing support measures with the aim of improving the basic conditions necessary for expanding organic farming. At the same time, it strives to increase supply and demand on a balanced, sustainable basis. These measures tackle all levels of organic farming, from the production to the consumption of organically produced food. Plans include training and information measures. Emphasis is also being placed on research promotion, the development of new technologies and steps to translate research findings into practice. Currently the FOFS is the main pool of the BMVEL for organic research funding.&#xD;

Cluster Knowledge management: Extension &#xD;
One main focus of the  Federal Organic Farming Scheme BÖL is to professionalise knowledge transfer and extension service for organic farming. Several measures and projects already start during the vocational training. An internet based knowledge portal containing teaching material about organic farming for agricultural vocational training was created in order to integrate organic farming subjects into the courses. Furthermore, a trainee programme for young extension workers was realised to optimise their preparation for the extension service. Also, for experienced advisors, further education considering different themes and methodological competence is being offered.&#xD;
In a project a “management handbook for organic agriculture” was compiled. It lists current practices, cost calculations, construction solutions and economical instruments for consultants and farmers. The handbook is available in the form of a book or an IT-programme. This handbook will be updated regularly.&#xD;
Research about extension on organic farms amongst others is focussing on the development of new extension tools. Organic farms often have a much more diverse production system than their conventional colleagues. For a competent assessment of once own strengths and weaknesses, it is of importance to separate the different production areas in order to do an economical calculation and to decide about correct inside farming prices for a product changing from one production area of the farm into another one. These questions are attended to by a large joint project including dairy farming, pig production, poultry, as well as field and vegetable crops.</dc:description>
