  <dc:description>Organic agriculture wishes to emphasise animal welfare, and aims to be at the forefront with regard to promoting the welfare of farm animals. It is therefore important to increase the expertise in the field of animal welfare in organic farming systems among veterinarians, advisers and farmers. An advisory service that includes on-farm assessment of animal welfare will contribute to securing a high level of animal welfare in organic production. To meet the need for information and expertise, an advisory and development project ”Good animal welfare in organic dairy farming”  started in May 2003 and will last until the end of 2005. The project’s main goal is to develop and establish a permanent advisory service aimed at securing a high level of animal health and welfare in organic dairy farming.</dc:description>
