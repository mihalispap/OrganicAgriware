  <dc:description>Organic chickens should forage in the woods, should increase their intake of plants and insects from attractive outdoor areas and should be revitalised with new breeds that exhibit a more natural foraging behaviour. These are some of the initiatives that will contribute to a more diverse, reliable and robust organic broiler production and which will be investigated in a new project in order to increase market share of the organic production.</dc:description>
