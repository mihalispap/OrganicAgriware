  <dc:title>The estimation of nutrient leaching from different agricultural management practices</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Air and water emissions</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The expectations of the growth in organic production are based on the consumers' assumptions of less environmental loading of this management practice. The requirements of more environmental support to be paid for organic farming are based on the same assumptions. &#xD;
&#xD;
Both the consumers and decision makers need more scientific data for their decisions on the environmental impacts through the life cycle of these management practices. The aim of this investigation is to collect all research results on the nutrient loading of organic and conventional farming, to produce model farms for estimating the loading through the life cycle of these management practices.</dc:description>
