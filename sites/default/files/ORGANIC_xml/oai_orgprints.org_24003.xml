  <dc:description>Participatory research in South of France aimed to create and exploit diversity on maize. Farmers and researchers have organized an on-farm experiment with traditional and new populations to assess key quality parameters. Population characteristics were evaluated through the different steps of food processes. Chef and cookers have also proposed new recipes to better exploit the diversity.</dc:description>
