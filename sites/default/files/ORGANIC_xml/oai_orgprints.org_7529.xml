  <dc:subject>Nutrient turnover</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Based on literature findings the paper deals with the question, which circumstances are connected with nutrient losses and by which means this can be reduced. Nitrogen rich, particularly ammonia rich manures seem to be predestined to have high N losses. Some recommendations concerning C:N ratio, turning of the heaps, how to avoid seepage produc-tion etc. can be derived. Strategies are suggested how to achieve favourable composting conditions</dc:description>
