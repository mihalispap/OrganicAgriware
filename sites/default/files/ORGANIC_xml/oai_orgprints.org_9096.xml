  <dc:description>Four concept papers outline parameters for the further development of organic food processing. They are based on other work already executed in the subproject 5 Processing in the QLIF-project, in particular the literature survey on “Underlying Principles in Organic and "Low-Input Food“ Processing – Literature Survey” published in 2004 by Schmid, Beck and Kretzschmar, as well as the “Approaches used in Organic/Low Input Food Processing - impact on food quality and safety” results of a Delphi survey from an expert consultation in 13 European countries.“ (Kretzschmar, Schmid, 2006).&#xD;
The four crucial topics highlighted in concept papers that have been chosen are summarised below:&#xD;
- 1rd Concept paper on the chances for a concept of “quality of origin” and on criteria and procedures for the evaluation of additives for organic food processing&#xD;
-2nd concept paper on environmental orientation of organic foods producing processing companies&#xD;
-3rd concept paper on processing methods and their labelling&#xD;
-4th concept paper on the improvement of separation practice by parallel processing of conventional and organic products</dc:description>
