  <dc:description>Organic farming has expanded rapidly in Europe since the 1980s. A key factor is the widespread use of policy support in recognition of environmental and other benefits. Agri-environmental payments are the main form of support. In 2003, almost 54% of the certified organic land area in the EU27 &amp; CH was supported at a cost of â‚¬635 million. The increase in supply thus stimulated led to a broader mix of meas-ures, including research, training, advice, consumer promotion and market development. Many states have adopted an integrated action plan approach to optimise the policy mix.</dc:description>
