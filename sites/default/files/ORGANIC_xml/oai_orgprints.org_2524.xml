  <dc:description>The Danish Research Centre for Organic Farming has initiated a knowledge synthesis that will provide an overview of the potential role of organic agriculture in a global perspective. The investigation will be performed by a group of Danish experts from a wide range of relevant fields in cooperation with international experts, and it is to provide a basis for launching a new research effort in this area. Organic agriculture can be seen as a tangible effort to create a sustainable food production. But modern European organic agriculture is undergoing a technological and structural modernisation and it is faced with a growing globalisation. And, even though there are large differences, the same is true for agriculture in development countries. The knowledge synthesis will have to consider the different meanings of globalisation and sustainable development and the different normative positions involved. The width of the field can be indicated by three positions on globalisation and sustainable development: &#xD;
A.	Growth and free trade without ecological borders (market liberalism) &#xD;
B.	Growth and free trade within certain limits (ecological economy) &#xD;
C.	Growth and free trade as a recipe for ecological injustice (political ecology)</dc:description>
