  <dc:description>This study inquired into integration of sustainable consumption and healthy eating in curriculum of three Finnish primary case schools, and carried out a preliminary in-depth probing into the working and outcomes of the 'whole school approach' in terms of teaching and learning. The whole school approach did portray as common effort by teachers and caterers to induce sustainability concept and reflective practices for pupils, and as such it presented new cross-curricular and transformative education binding reflection with knowledge and practices for every-day sustainability behaviors. As part of education for sustainable development and food education for sustainability in particular, organic food as an illustration for sustainability was used in one case school. Even though very fragmented and small-scale, the study suggests that sustainability education and sustainable food education do have chances to challenge current societal developments by today's pupils, the future citizens and consumers.</dc:description>
