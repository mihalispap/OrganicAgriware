  <dc:description>Banana owing to its large size and rapid growth rate require relatively large amount of nutrients for higher yield of quality fruits and it is estimated that 50 tonnes of banana in one hectare removes 320kg N, 32kg P2O5 and 925 kg K2O every year (Lahav and Turner, 1983). Application of inorganic fertilizers though increases the yield substantially but could not able to sustain the fertility status of the soil (Bharadwaj and Omanwar, 1994) and have caused several undesirable consequences in the fragile soil eco-system, leading to gradual decline in productivity. Considering the present situation of soil quality and environmental security, it is necessary to go for an integrated nutrient management, involving various sources of organic manures, organic cakes and bio-fertilizers besides using chemical fertilizers in banana. In today’s cultivation many commercial organic manures are being used because of their application in lesser volume and also enriched with nutrients. One such commercial organic manure used in the study is Wellgro. Wellgro organic manure is a unique product with a blend of neem and non-timber forest produce and a rich source of nutrients. Hence, this study was under taken to find out the influence of ecofriendly nutrient management practices on yield and quality parameters of banana under irrigated conditions.</dc:description>
