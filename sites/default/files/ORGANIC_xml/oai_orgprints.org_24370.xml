  <dc:description>For ten years, innovative forms of distribution of organic products emerged between long supply chain and short supply chain. We defined them as " localized agri-food supply chains". Our work is based on the analysis of 18 localized food supply chains in  Rhône-Alpes (France). Firstly, it presents the diversity of these localized supply chains and the mechanisms implemented to address the limits of short supply chains, particularly an increasing number of intermediaries. &#xD;
Then we assess their performances with regard to the advantages commonly lent to short supply chains. We demonstrate that localized supply chains are in some cases a vehicle for conventionalisation of organic agriculture and in other a form of mitigation of the agribusiness model.</dc:description>
