  <dc:description>The aim of the Ph.D. project was to examine the consequences for the farm of an organic milk production based entirely on home-grown feed. The project included interviews that identified what in farmersâ€™ opinion is crucial for obtaining organic milk production based entirely on home-grown feed, production experiments that examined the effects of different types of home-grown concentrated feed on milk production and scenario calculations that described the consequences for productivity, economy, and nutrient balances of organic milk production based entirely on home-grown feed.</dc:description>
