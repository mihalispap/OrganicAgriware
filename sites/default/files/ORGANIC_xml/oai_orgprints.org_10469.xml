  <dc:description>In this overview, the preceding effects of crop pairs are classified by establishing schematic diagrams for use in crop rotation planning in low external input or organic agricultural systems. Results from previous crop rotation trials and earlier diagrams cited in the literature were evaluated in order to classify the succession effects for more than 25 main crop species. Additional information about several cultivation remarks were annotated in small letters for every crop sequence. In a tabular overview, the crop species were arranged into three main categories according to the different duration of their pre-crop effects: I. N fixing, soil fertility increasing legumes and legume-grass mixtures; II. N depleting, intense soil fertility reducing non-legumes; III. modest soil fertility reducing non-legumes.</dc:description>
