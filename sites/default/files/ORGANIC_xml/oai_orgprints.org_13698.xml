  <dc:description>Resistance breeding in apple has a long tradition at the Institute of Fruit Breeding now Julius Kuehn-institute in Dresden-Pillnitz. The breeding was aimed at the production of multiple resistance cultivars to allow a more sustainable and environmentally friendly production of apple. In the last decades a series of resistant cultivars (Re®-cultivars) bred in Dresden-Pillnitz has been released, ‘Recolor’ and ‘Rekarda’ in 2006. The main topic in the resistance breeding programme was scab resistance and the donor of scab resistance in most cultivars was Malus x floribunda 821. Due to the development of strains that are able to overcome resistance genes inherited by M. x floribunda 821 and due to the fact that single resistance genes can be broken easily, pyramiding of resistance genes is necessary. Besides scab, fire blight and powdery mildew are the main disease for which a pyramiding of genes is aspired in Pillnitz. Biotechnical approaches are necessary for the early detection of pyramided resistance genes in breeding clones. This paper will give an overview of the resistance breeding of apple in Pillnitz and the methods used.</dc:description>
