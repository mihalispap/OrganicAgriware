  <dc:description>The demand for organic food is often reported as exceeding supply. When faced with just such a shortfall in supply, Australian egg supplier G. O. Drew Pty Ltd substituted non-organic eggs to fill the supply gap. That deception has cost the company $295,000, the egg business has been sold, and the owners are no longer egg suppliers or packers.&#xD;
&#xD;
The 2007 case of ACCC v G. O. Drew Pty Ltd is a milestone for the Australian organic sector - it is the first Australian case where the Australian Consumer &amp; Competition Commission (ACCC) has publicly challenged organic food labelling claims. This compares to at least 16 cases where the ACCC has successfully challenged false and/or misleading Country of Origin labelling (CoOL). Details of the case and problematic issues with the judgement are discussed.</dc:description>
