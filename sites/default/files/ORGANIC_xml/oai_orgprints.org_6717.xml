  <dc:description>UK agriculture is faced with the need to reduce diffuse pollution, particularly of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), whilst remaining economically viable. Spring lupins can provide a high protein grain of known provenance and source of oils and balanced energy for optimised ruminant and non ruminant livestock production. They have the potential to increase the efficiency of N and P use in arable rotations and in mixed arable livestock systems. This five year project is the first comprehensive evaluation of the benefits and disbenefits of this crop for organic and conventional use in the UK. Comparisons with other grain legumes will analyse on farm nutrient budgets, feed utilisation, emissions from animal wastes and agronomic factors. Molecular markers for key traits will be identified and brought together as a ‘breeder’s toolkit’ available for lupin improvement. A major element of the project will be dissemination and exploitation by the end users (UK farmers) and other beneficiaries.</dc:description>
