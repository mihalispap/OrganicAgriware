  <dc:description>Abstract - To date in organic viticulture grapevine downy mildew is controlled mainly by treatments with copper. Under favourable conditions the disease spreads rapidly and causes severe losses of yield and quality. To develop a strategy for the biological con-trol of grapevine downy mildew, the infection cycle of the pathogen has been investigated in detail. On the basis of the biological data, a model for the specific control of grapevine has been developed. This model indicates the most suitable stages of the infection cycle for the precise control of the disease .</dc:description>
