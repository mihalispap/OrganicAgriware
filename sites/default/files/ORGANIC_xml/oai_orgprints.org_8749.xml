  <dc:description>With commodity prices continuing to decrease and with policy constraint that farmers&#xD;
cannot easily increase their incomes by increasing volumes of production, they must&#xD;
find alternative ways to maintain their standard of living. This can be achieved by&#xD;
either niche marketing of agricultural products or by environmental payments, which&#xD;
are either paid by the government or the consumer.&#xD;
The results of a consumer survey carried out in Less Favoured Areas in Scotland,&#xD;
Germany, Greece, France and Italy to assess consumer attitudes of what constitutes&#xD;
the quality of lamb and the extent to which this provides an opportunity to exploit&#xD;
niche marketing, are discussed. Consumers generally have much less interest in the&#xD;
use of regional labelling, ecologically friendly production systems or the linkage of&#xD;
landscape and production systems in the buying decision. It is concluded that&#xD;
potential exists to develop niche markets for lamb and that these niches demonstrate&#xD;
significant regional differences. Equally, however, it is concluded that there are only&#xD;
limited rewards for production systems which are sympathetic to the environment. To&#xD;
achieve this goal, policy intervention is required, geared directly to environmental&#xD;
management practices. Future policy support towards farmers in LFAs is needed as a&#xD;
mix of policy instrument. Nowadays, financial support of farming in LFAs is&#xD;
necessary to grant farmers income, but structural support (e. g. in marketing products&#xD;
under reliable labelling towards consumersâ€™ requests with trust in the "added&#xD;
values") can help to increase LFA-farmers income without increasing subsidies.</dc:description>
