  <dc:description>“In vivo” performance and carcass characteristics of Maremmana young bulls and steers were evaluated during a three year extension service program based on the improvement of animal performance and the production of steers. Average slaughter ages were 568, 562 and 642 (P&lt;0.01) days and the average slaughter weights were 494.2, 567.2 and 548.2 kgs (P&lt;0.01) respectively for young bulls in the first and second trial year and steers in the third, with a dressing percentage of 52.3%, 53.6% and 54.82% (P&lt;0.01) respectively. No significant differences were found in carcass conformation and fatness scores which were similar to those found by other authors in the same breed reared in similar conditions.</dc:description>
