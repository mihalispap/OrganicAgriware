  <dc:description>In three long-term studies Yard Waste Composts (YWC) turned out to be sustainable suppressive to Pythium and Phytophthora root rot reducing the disease up to 98%. This was shown under lab and commercial conditions with composts from model and pilot-scale systems. Though suppression was related to microbial activity of the media we could not find a single microbial indicator for suppression over a wide range of samples. High quality YWC of different age showed distinct DNA fingerprints but similar suppressive effects. Thus, still it remains unclear what kind of microbial populations and functions are affecting disease suppression. However, non-destructive near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) turned out to predict suppression at least satisfactorily.</dc:description>
