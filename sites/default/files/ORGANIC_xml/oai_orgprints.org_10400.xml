  <dc:description>The fungus Didymella lycopersici infects tomato seed and results in great losses before and after germination. To control the disease, seed companies use thiram preventively, although human allergy problems have been reported. For this reason as well as to address needs in organic agriculture, this study has focused on the effects of alternative methods of control. Nitrite solutions and resistance inducers were tested in a growth chamber. Results showed that soaking the seed in a nitrite solution with a concentration of 300mÎœ (in citric acid buffer, pH 2) for 10 minutes reduced losses due to low seed germination and disease incidence in the germinated seedlings completely. When applied for longer intervals sodium nitrite proved phytotoxic whereas in shorter intervals it was not as effective. The resistance inducer Tillecur (mustard seed extract) at the rate of 0.05g/ml was as much effective as sodium nitrite inhibiting disease incidence in germinated seedlings. None of the above treatments was significantly different to thiram and they could replace the fungicide in the control of seedborne D. lycopersici in tomato.</dc:description>
