  <dc:description>On the clay loam soil in 0-0,05 m layer, the average dry bulk density of ploughed soil was greater than that of reduced tilled soils. This was probably due to the higher organic matter content of reduced tilled plots. On the clay soil, the differences in soil dry bulk density were, however, small. In the 0-0,05 m layer, the differences in macropore size distribution were small on both fields.</dc:description>
