  <dc:description>It is intrinsic to fulfilling any aspirations that we have to spread the organic concept of health and it is vital to the wellbeing of our society and that of future generations for us to find and practice an alternative to the destructive and iniquitous spread of globalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
This conference posed the question – “Local and Organic in a Global Food Economy: What is our role? - As farmers, as consumers, as citizens? – What is our role? my perspective of the global food economy is that we have to, in the first place and urgently, develop an alternative to it. A locally based food economy is right for nutritional reasons, for development reasons, and for socio-economic reasons. But more than that, we have no choice if we wish to preserve anything that resembles a democratic and civilised society.&#xD;
&#xD;
We live in world of finite and rapidly diminishing resources: quite apart from being inequitable and a moral abomination, the global growth economy upon which we struggle to base our society is untenable. It is in fundamental conflict with the biological base of our planet and must be replaced as our civilisation's central organising principle.</dc:description>
