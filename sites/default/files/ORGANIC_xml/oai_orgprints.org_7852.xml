  <dc:description>Rijk Zwaan Seed Company offers organic vegetable seeds to the market. Breeding of varieties especially for the organic market has started, but only on a basic level. More knowledge and a more important market are needed to justify a higher input. In organic seed production many problems are encountered, espe-cially in seed production of biennial crops. Therefore much effort is put on improving the organic seed production of these crops, in cooperation with other companies, universities and institutes. Advanced seed treatments are needed to avoid seed borne pathogens. For further growth of the market for organic vegetable seeds, more knowledge, commit-ment in the whole organic chain and unambiguous regulations are needed.</dc:description>
