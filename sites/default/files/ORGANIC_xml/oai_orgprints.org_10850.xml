  <dc:description>A questionnaire survey of about 2500 farmers who had contacted OCIS in Wales since 1996 was used to find out why more horticultural producers were not converting to organic production. Of 272 respondents, 43 had a horticultural enterprise on their farm and 26 identified horticulture as one of their main enterprises.&#xD;
&#xD;
Twelve of these converted, but the main reasons given by the remainder for not converting were the cost of certification and the low level of OFS payments. The OFS provides only limited support for horticulture enterprises as payments are based on area, and many holdings are small and may even be ineligible for payment. No concerns were expressed about the market.</dc:description>
