  <dc:subject>Policy environments and social economy</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The EU-CEEOFP project will identify how the complementary development of Organic Farming (OF) in both existing EU states, Switzerland, and in Central and Eastern European (CEE) Accession states can be fostered through policy design and innovation. &#xD;
&#xD;
The project will cover all EU-15 member states, Switzerland and CEE Accession states (Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia).  However detailed research efforts will be concentrated on selected countries:&#xD;
&#xD;
Austria, Denmark and Switzerland as representatives of states with more developed OF relevant policies; &#xD;
&#xD;
Germany because it has the largest organic market in Europe; &#xD;
&#xD;
the United Kingdom and Italy as representatives of countries in a stage of dynamic development; &#xD;
&#xD;
the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland and Slovenia, the first “accession wave” (excluding Cyprus).</dc:description>
