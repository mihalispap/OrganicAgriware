  <dc:description>The effect of some herbs with strengthening immune system and antiphlogistic action from Bulgaria has been studied in two pilot trials, first with 8 litters (4 control and 4 with herbs in the water) and second with 15 litters (5 control, 5 with herbs in the water and 5 with herbs in the fodder). The growth and health status (score of diarrhoea) during the suckling period has been recorded. Treatment of diarrhoea with herbs has been applied to litters with manifestation of diarrhoea in second trial. The results showed that supplement of herbs in the water or in the fodder of suckling piglets improved growth and health status of piglets and further studies are needed for establishing the best combination of herbs.</dc:description>
