  <dc:title>Technical and economic performances in organic sheep for meat production. Comparison of 2 systems in experimental farm.</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Sheep and goats</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Systemic approach to study organic sheep for meat production.&#xD;
Two flocks of 100 ewes. Fodder area 2x24ha and crops 2*1,5ha.&#xD;
Sheep house for 200 ewes and their lambs and device to make measurements&#xD;
Items studied : animal reproduction, feeding, health (parasitism), forages, economics, environnement.&#xD;
One system is based on one lambing per ewe per year ; the second one is based on accelerated reproduction (3 lambings over 2 years). Spring lambs fattened with grass.&#xD;
