  <dc:description>In December 2005 a questionnaire survey was conducted at the university hospital in Trondheim, Norway. Patients and personnel expressed that food is important for their health and well-being. Good taste, appearance and right nutrition were mentioned to be important factors for food quality. About 80 % of the respondents were positive or really positive to use organic food at the hospital, even though only around half of them agreed that it is worth the price. Furthermore the absence of pesticides, artificial fertilizers and preservatives in food was ranked to be more important than organic production of food. All respondents seemed to be critical towards the use of pesticides and preservatives in food production and processing.</dc:description>
