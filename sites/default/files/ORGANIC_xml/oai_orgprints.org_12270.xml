  <dc:description>Biological Nitrogen fixation (BNF) should be the most important means for N supply in organic agriculture. This study aimed at assessing the effect of fifteen legume cultivars on subsequent crops in three consecutive growing seasons to identify the most efficient and suitable ones as building crops in rotation programs under Mediterranean environment. T. subterraneum cv. York and T. glanduliferum cv. Prima, induced the best effects on wheat, particularly on total biomass, number of grains, dry matter production and increased yield by 670% and 567% respectively more than the control.</dc:description>
