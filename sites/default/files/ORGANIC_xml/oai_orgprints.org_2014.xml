  <dc:description>This study deals with the question under which circumstances (concerning milk and CuCl2-concentration per picture) and with which variation the method of biocrystallisa-tion is able to distinguish different milk qualities. Milk qualities are UHT- and raw milk as well as milk from the beginning (A-milk) and ending (E-milk) of lactation. A matrix from different mixing ratios showed that milk qualities are best visually differentiated by 350µL milk and 175mg CuCl2 per plate. However there exists a certain variation in repeatedly produced pictures of one quality. Therefore 38% of the A- and E-milk-pictures were sorted out because of technical errors (unusual morphology). With 42% of the pictures the two samples were successfully differentiated by describing the morphological features. With the texture analysis program a significant difference between the samples (p&lt;0,05) was found when analysing selected regions of the picture.</dc:description>
