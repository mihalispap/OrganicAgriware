  <dc:description>This paper presents and comments on basis data for point of sale marketing on organic products. The research on promotions to date has been directed only towards conventional products. Therefore, the main issue of the study is to offer an overview of sales promotion instruments as well as evaluating different kinds of sales promotions and improving their effectiveness for organic products. The research addresses the optimal design of a series of promotions, which especially approach non-customers and occasional customers of organic products. This study is based on a quantitative empirical method which allows the comparison of sales promotion effectiveness for organic food in food retailing and specialised organic food retailing. Besides that, the study provides producers as well as retailers with an appropriate performance rating of their organic product sales promotion.</dc:description>
