  <dc:description>The development of thrips populations and thrips damage in 15 cabbage varieties was monitored in two years of field experiments in the Netherlands..  A number of morphological and physiological plant traits were also measured. The most important factors leading to a low level of thrips damage were late development of a compact head, a low Brix value and a high amount of leaf wax. Two open-pollinated cabbage varieties with low and high susceptibility to thrips damage were crossed in both reciprocal combinations. The resulting F1 populations were intermediate for susceptibility to thrips damage.</dc:description>
