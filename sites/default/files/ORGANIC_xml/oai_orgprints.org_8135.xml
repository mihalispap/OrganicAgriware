  <dc:description>Several recent studies on the results of organic dairy farmers show that this system is not always better than conventional (Brinkman and Winkler, 2006). Sundrum (2006) asks, if there are no differences in the quality between organic and conventional products, why should consumers pay a higher price for these products? There are several possible reasons why ODF does not show the outcomes in relation to animal health and welfare that we might expect from the stated intentions: &#xD;
1. The economic situation of the farms, price and the lack of a suitable schemes to reward high quality milk production. &#xD;
2. R&amp;D support of ODF, how research topics and research methods are chosen, and the communication between researchers, advisors and farmers. &#xD;
3. The power of established institutions and the courage of farmers in making a difference.</dc:description>
