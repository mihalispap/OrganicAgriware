  <dc:description>The Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries presented in spring 2004 a bill on co-existence of genetically modified, conventional and organic crops in support of the free choice of consumers and to ensure development possibilities for new and existing production forms. The bill contains a framework for regulation based on crop specific control measures, communication among farmers and mandatory courses in GM cultivation. The identification of control measures is based on the report form the Danish analysis group and from the presentations and discussions at the First European Conference on Co-existence, GMCC-03.</dc:description>
