  <dc:description>The efficacy of different insecticides (neem, pyrethrin, spinosad, and rotenone) and a repellent (kaolin)&#xD;
applied with different strategies (single or repeated applications) against the over-wintering pear&#xD;
suckers (Cacopsylla pyri) and nymphs of the first generation was tested in a field trial in Switzerland&#xD;
in spring 2003.&#xD;
Rotenone, the only admitted product in Swiss organic agriculture, showed good effects. But, since&#xD;
Rotenone is toxic for non-target insects we looked for an alternative. The application of spinosad&#xD;
(Audienz) in combination with rape oil (Telmion) as well as the application of pyrethrum showed&#xD;
similar efficacy as rotenone. Neem had no or a very low impact on the pear sucker populations. The&#xD;
repellent kaolin (SurroundÂ® WP) showed the best efficacy against the European pear sucker: triple&#xD;
application of kaolin before blossom was most efficient. Since kaolin is not toxic for beneficials this&#xD;
product might be an alternative to rotenone.</dc:description>
