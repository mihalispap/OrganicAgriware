  <dc:description>While the built environment responds to the needs of adults, it is sufficient to shrink the built environment to children’s scale. At that point, the importance of the natural habitats of the city comes up to balance the difference of this scale. In this study, the relationship between children and the natural habitat is examined with a practice based on the permaculture strategies. Permaculture has different application areas. Although, rural areas are the most preferable space to implementation, to repair bonds, which are severed from nature by modern life, meaning also from earth, permaculture should be applied in urban areas.</dc:description>
