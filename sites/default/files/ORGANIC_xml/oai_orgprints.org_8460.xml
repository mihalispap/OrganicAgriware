  <dc:description>The effect of different fertilizer application techniques on nitrous oxide and methane emissions were investigated in a field experiment. Gas fluxes were measured during a five months period in 2001 from a barley field located in Vihti, southern Finland. The effects of different fertilizer application techniques on crop yield and quality were also investigated. According to the results, slurry injection produced the most N2O during the measurement period. Placement of mineral fertilizer produced least N2O. Methane fluxes were close to zero and there were no statistically significant differences between the treatments.</dc:description>
