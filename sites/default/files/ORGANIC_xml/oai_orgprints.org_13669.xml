  <dc:description>Modern high-input agriculture has produced great increases in crop yields but social&#xD;
and environmental costs have also been high. Over the past decades, sustainability&#xD;
has become more and more a guiding principle in agriculture. In this context, organic&#xD;
farming became recognised by farmers, policymakers and consumers as one of the&#xD;
possibilities for the farmer in a more sustainable way (De Cock L., 2005).</dc:description>
