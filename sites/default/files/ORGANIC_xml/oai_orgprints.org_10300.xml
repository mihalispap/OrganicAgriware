  <dc:title>Soil Monitoring Programmes at Sheepdrove Organic Farm 2003-2004</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Soil quality</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Soil is a finite resource and is increasingly under pressure from a variety of human activities for example agriculture, construction and mineral extraction. However, for generations soil has been the basis for agricultural production, a raw material, which with sensitive management can be used year after year.  &#xD;
Sheepdrove Organic Farm is striving to reach its goal, of developing a high quality food production system with adherence to strict policies of high animal health and welfare and increasing biodiversity and environmental benefits. &#xD;
Objective 1 is to implement a rolling soil analysis programme so that every year fields entering or leaving the fertility-building phase are sampled for soil nutrient status. The information gathered from this monitoring programme ensures that the farms soil and nutrient resources are used optimally. &#xD;
Objective 2   is to assess the differential nutrient statuses between stable habitats, represented by old woodland and pasture, and more disturbed/dynamic habitats that occur within the ley-arable rotation.  &#xD;
Objective 3 is to measure the biological activity within the soil, by using a relatively quick and simple technique to measure gross soil respiration.</dc:description>
