  <dc:description>The coffee segment that is known as sustainable has grown much faster than nearly any other industry segment in the past decade. It is difficult to understand both the market trends and the impacts of these coffees and it is therefore difficult for producers, industry and even consumers to make rational decisions. This paper consolidates the best available data on the global trade volumes for all of the certified (or verified) coffee in the past decade and the distribution by major geographic regions.</dc:description>
