  <dc:description>Although the use of tanniferous plants or condensed tannins as an alternative to anthelmintics to&#xD;
control gastrointestinal nematodes has been largely documented in sheep, studies remain scarce in&#xD;
goats. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the possible impact of condensed tannins&#xD;
in goats infected with adult Haemonchus contortus. Two groups of cull goats were experimentally&#xD;
infected with 10.000 L3 of H. contortus. After 4 weeks, quebracho extracts, representing 5%&#xD;
of the diet DM, were administered for 8 days to one of the two groups. Goats of the second&#xD;
group remained as controls. One week after the end of quebracho administration, the goats were&#xD;
euthanised. Individual egg excretion and pathophysiological parameters were measured weekly&#xD;
during the study. At the end of the study, worm counts were assessed and histological samples&#xD;
from the abomasa were taken to count the numbers of mucosal mast cells, globule leukocytes&#xD;
and eosinophils. The administration of tannins was associated with a significant decrease in egg&#xD;
excretion, which persisted until the end of experiment. This reduction was not associated with&#xD;
any difference in worm number but with a significant decrease in female fecundity. No significant&#xD;
changes in the mucosal density of the three inflammatory cell types were detected between the&#xD;
two groups. These results indicate that the major consequence of tannin consumption in goats is a&#xD;
reduction in worm fecundity and egg output, which does not seem related to significant changes in&#xD;
the local mucosal response.</dc:description>
