  <dc:description>At the recent elections the World Board of the organic movement’s international governing body, IFOAM, there was a major changing of the guard. Vanaja Ramprasad  was one of the members newly elected to the ten-member World Board of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements. She is the director of India's Green Foundation and she has a passionate interest in “the real reasons for third world poverty and hunger”. In this interview she explains: "My interest in the work was inspired by the deep desire to understand the reasons for the disconnect I saw between the food system and the distancing of the very people who produced it". She declares that organics offers "the only future if the planet is to survive".</dc:description>
