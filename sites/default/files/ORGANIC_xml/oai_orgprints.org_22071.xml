  <dc:description>Regarding a soil compaction survey carried out at the end of 2008 by the Estonian University of Life Sciences in collaboration with the Agricultural Research Centre, soil&#xD;
compaction was define as one of the currently bigger problems in Estonian soils (Reintam et al., 2010). Soil compaction reduces porosity, permeability and therefore water flow through the soil is blocked, increasing the soil erosion and creating anoxic conditions in the bulk&#xD;
which causes denitrification, and therefore the uptake of nutrients is reduced (Bakken et al., 1987). In conclusion soil compaction affects directly to the plant root development and crop yield.</dc:description>
