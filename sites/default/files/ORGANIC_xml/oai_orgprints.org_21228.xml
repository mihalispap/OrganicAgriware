  <dc:description>This paper reveals that the first public lecture in Australia on biodynamic agriculture was held on 26 June 1938 at the home of the architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahoney Griffin at Castlecrag, Sydney. This meeting is a seminal event in the history of the development of organic farming in Australia. The Griffins were responsible for the design of Australiaâ€™s capital city, Canberra. They were introduced to Anthroposophy in Australia, with Marion joining the Anthroposophic Society in Australia in 1930 and Walter joining in 1931. They each played an active and prominent role in the discussion, dissemination, presentation and celebration of the thoughts and teachings of Rudolf Steiner. Marion wrote an extensive unpublished memoir of over 1600 typescript pages and this paper draws on that memoir and other primary sources.</dc:description>
