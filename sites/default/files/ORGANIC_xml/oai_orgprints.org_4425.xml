  <dc:description>As organic farming has become an instrument of European agricultural policy, the organic sector is required more and more to become politically active. This paper presents results from an EU-funded project i) analysing the development of organic farming institutions for the period of 1997-2003 in eleven European countries and ii) investigating networks of organic farming policy on national and EU levels following the network analysis approach. The study concludes that institutions within the organic farming sector in new EU member states are still developing, and their relationship with mainstream farming institutions is characterised by a state of competition. In 15 (old) EU countries and Switzerland, this relation is more oriented towards co-operation and has been described as being in a state of creative conflict. Countries with a high share of organic farming show signs of consolidation of their institutions. Organic farming policy networks are bigger in size and denser in these countries compared to the small networks in new member states. Organic farming organisations, as well as state institutions play an important role in all national networks for organic farming policy-making. On the EU level, the network of organic farming policy actors is still at an initial stage. The different patterns of relationship between institutions and networks of the organic sector provide a basis for recommendations for political strategies of organic farming actors.</dc:description>
