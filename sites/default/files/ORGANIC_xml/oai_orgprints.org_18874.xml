  <dc:description>Europe has a new organics logo from 1 July 2010. The new  logo is mandated for all organic produce of Europe. The new logo is the product of a Europe-wide competition which attracted 3,422 entries, of which three were shortlisted and subjected to an internet vote. The new logo is text-free. It does not replace the plethora of certifier-specific logos currently used by Europe's certifiers, instead, it will appear in conjunction with certifier logos. When presented with this logo, half of respondents recognised the new logo as a leaf; others reported that it looked like a shooting star (17%), a fish (10%), stars (7%), other (7%), and 'don't know (10%).</dc:description>
