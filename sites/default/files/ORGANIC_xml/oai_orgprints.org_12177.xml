  <dc:description>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of old and new copper formulations to control downy mildew Plasmopara viticola (Berk. et Curtis) Berl. et. De Toni). Field trials were carried out over the years 2002, 2004 and 2005 in a grapevine  growing area in the Po Valley with a high disease pressure. Among the traditional copper formulations, hydroxide-based products gave the best results. Other new copper formulations, including foliar fertilizers, simple adjuvants and resistance inducers were evaluated. In particular, resistance inducers with a low percentage of copper gave promising results even though some of them show some phytotoxic problems.</dc:description>
