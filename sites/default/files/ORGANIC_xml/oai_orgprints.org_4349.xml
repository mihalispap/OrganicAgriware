  <dc:description>The implications of a full conversion to organic farming were analysed for two Austrian regions (a grassland area: Liezen, and a cropping area: the Weinviertel). The results show few differences between organic and conventional farms in the grassland region. In the arable region a full conversion to organic farming shows marked benefits not only for the environment but also from an economic point of view. Different preconditions in scenarios underline that the prognosis for r future income is uncertain. In both regions, the majority of farmers emphasise different reasons that they did not see organic farming as a realistic alternative to their current production system.</dc:description>
