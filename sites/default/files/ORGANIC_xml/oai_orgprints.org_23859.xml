  <dc:description>“I’m the Organic Style (ITOS)” is a youth program provided by NOASM (Namyangju Organic Agricultural Science Museum). The participants of ITOS program are middle school students aged from 14 to16 years old. The ITOS program is a self-designed program aimed at the production of organic vegetables to make food. As part of the program for learning about social relations, the participants cook slow food by using their self-grown vegetables and serving them to community elders as a one-day meal. The ITOS impacts the importance of community agriculture and imparts the emotional, educational, and social welfare perspectives to teenaged students.</dc:description>
