  <dc:description>There is a general need to increase grain legume protein production in Europe to meet an increasing demand. A certain import of conventionally produced protein feed sources is presently allowed on organic farms, e.g. soybean meal, free of genetically modified soybean grain, and oilseed rape cakes. However, from 2005 all feed used in animal production must be organically produced according to EU regulations. In that perspective evaluation of potentials for increased protein production via the growing of grain legumes in organic cropping systems is urgent.</dc:description>
