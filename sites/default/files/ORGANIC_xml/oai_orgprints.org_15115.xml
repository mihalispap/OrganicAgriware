  <dc:description>Direct drilling has been studied by MTT Agrifood Research Finland since the 1980s, but conclusions here are mainly based on field trials on clay soils in 2000s. Differences in amount and quality of yield from ploughed and no-till soil vary between years, fields and species. Timing and implementation of drilling in no-till soil is especially challenging. Oat did grow and yield more reliably than other spring cetreals when direct drilled. The protein content of spring cereal grains was low in direct drilling.</dc:description>
