  <dc:description>This report presents a discussion of how organic farming and social capital development can contribute towards the restoration of sustainable agricultural livelihoods in a post-conflict setting; with a case study of Northern Uganda. Strictly speaking, the paper goes beyond a simple exposition of the value of organic farming, but it attempts to explain the complex ways in which social capital relates with organic farming to revitalize sustainable agricultural systems, and how this can impact on the livelihoods of communities in a post-conflict situation, with respect to household food security and income.</dc:description>
