  <dc:description>Grazing cattle are needed to preserve 450 000 hectares of semi-natural grasslands of high biodiversity in Sweden. Keeping cattle outdoors promotes their health and possibili¬ties to conduct natural behaviors. Working with cattle on pasture however, can increase accident rates (Health and Safety Authority, 2011). During the last two years, five fatali¬ties and several accidents have occurred during handling of cattle in Sweden. A method, based on knowledge of the animals’ natural behavior, referred to as low stress stock han¬dling (LSS-method), has been introduced to Sweden for cattle handling (Atkinson, 2011). A handler who consistently uses this method prevents the use of hits, sticks, harsh voice or negative forceful handling techniques. A consistent predictable approach from the han¬dler creates consistent and predictable animal behavior in return. Cattle become more trusting with their handlers and consequently more cooperative. This positive interaction between human being and animal can lead to both a safer work situation and a better animal welfare. On two of five studied farms so far, the LSS-method was actually inter¬vened during the observations, resulted in a successful reversal of conflict behaviour. On farm1, a highly stressed heifer took over three hours in attempt to load into a transport. It was successfully loaded within an hour after the intervention. On another farm, five escaped cows that the farmer had attempted to capture unsuccessfully for three conse¬cutive weeks were successfully captured through using the LSS-method.</dc:description>
