  <dc:description>In order to establish the extent to which each of the technical sequences regarding the preparation of wine for bottling (3 final filtration thresholds: 0.65µm, 2µm and 5µm) were in keeping with the cellar objectives and to measure the analytical, microbiological and organoleptic impact on the wine for each sequence, over a one-year period, we monitored a red wine prepared according to the 3 methodologies. A low initial microbiological level (absence of Brettanomyces, Pédiococcus and Lactobacillus), combined with a stable active SO2 content between 0.4 and 0.5 mg/l, enabled analytical and microbiological stability of all the wines compared. The triangular tests performed by a panel of trained oenologists did not reveal any significant differences linked to the technical sequences compared.</dc:description>
