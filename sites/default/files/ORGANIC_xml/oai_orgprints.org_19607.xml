  <dc:description>Currently the Danish organic fruit &amp; berry production area is 502 ha with the main crop being apples at 282 ha. FruitGrowth will address the main barriers identified by the ‘Working Group report, 2009’, by focussing on robust cultivars in apples, new innovative weeding methods and extending the fruit season &amp; thereby product availability for consumers we will introduce new cultivars &amp; technologies in storage.  We work on short &amp; long time solutions of the key pests &amp; diseases (codling moth, apple sawfly &amp; apple scab in apples), natural beneficial’s in flower strips, &amp; natural compound to control key pest. FruitGrowth includes research, development, demonstration &amp; dissemination of the results to fruit growers. Outcomes are expected to contribute to a market-driven growth of unique, high value fresh organic apples from local sustainable &amp; profitable production systems, through increasing grower, industry and consumer confidence in Danish grown organic apples.</dc:description>
