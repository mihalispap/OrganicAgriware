  <dc:description>The paper explores the influence of policy support on the development of the organic sector. Policies include the agri-environment (EU Regulation 2078/92), the EU regulation 2092/91 defining organic crop-production in statutory terms and policies to support market and regional development and the information provision of organic farming. Policy makers have been interested in organic farming for its environmental and health benefits and the potential to contribute to the goals of regional development programmes. The evaluation suggests that the variation in support policies alone can not explain the different rates of conversion to organic farming in the EU.</dc:description>
