  <dc:description>Abstract: Organic farming is becoming more and more popular among Polish farmers. In the year of the accession of Poland to the European Union, the number of certified organic farms amounted to 1683. By the end of 2005, which is after the first year of Poland’s membership in the EU, the number of farms practicing exclusively organic farming or taking up that course of production amounted to more than 7000. &#xD;
On the basis of agricultural accountancy from 2004, an economic and production evaluation of 110 organic farms included in the Polish FADN sample was carried out. The organic farms were classified into 5 classes of economic size. 92% of them were of economic size below 16 ESU. The study contains economic and production results achieved by a group of farms belonging to the principal type TF60 “Mixed cropping” and included in the type TF8 „Field crops”.</dc:description>
