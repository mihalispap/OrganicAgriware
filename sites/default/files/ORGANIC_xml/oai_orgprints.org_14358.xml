  <dc:description>Three winter wheat composite cross (CC) populations were created in 2001 in the UK&#xD;
consisting either of 20 modern wheat parents (called A Population), a subset of 12&#xD;
high quality parents (Q), or a subset of 9 high yielding parents (Y). Seed of the F4 was&#xD;
transferred to the University of Kassel in 2005 and the populations were grown since&#xD;
then under organic and conventional conditions in well separated large (&gt;100m2) plots&#xD;
in two parallel sets (12 populations total) without conscious selection applied. In the&#xD;
conventional system fungicides and insecticides were not applied to expose the&#xD;
populations to natural pest and disease pressure. Morphological diversity, diseases,&#xD;
and yield were assessed in the field every season. The parents and a total of 1379&#xD;
single plants of 23 single seed progenies of the F5 were tested in the laboratory for&#xD;
their combined resistance to three brown rust isolates. Only one progeny was&#xD;
homogenous in reaction, all others were mixtures of two to eight three-locus&#xD;
genotypes. Despite the supposed inbreeding structure of wheat one association in the&#xD;
Q progenies was random suggesting recent out-crossing. Thus, diversity and&#xD;
heterogeneity was still high in the F6 with evidence that out-crossing still played a role&#xD;
and contributed to this heterogeneity.</dc:description>
