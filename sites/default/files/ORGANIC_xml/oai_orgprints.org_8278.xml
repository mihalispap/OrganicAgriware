  <dc:description>This report is the third from a series of four economic reports on organic farm incomes from 2001/02 through to 2004/05. The work was carried out by Organic Research Group at the Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA on the economic performance of organic farms in 2003/04 on behalf of DEFRA Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. &#xD;
A fundamental aim of this work is to assess the financial performance of organic farms differentiated by farm type, in order to inform DEFRA policy-making with respect to economics of organic farming, and to provide a basis for assessments by farmers, advisers and other interested parties of the farm-level implications of conversion to and continued organic farming.&#xD;
This research area builds on previous economics work on organic farming carried out by Institute of Rural Sciences, UWA (Project OF0190, covering 1995/96 to 1998/99). Here, time series data are shown using an identical farm analysis technique for the 2002/03 and 2003/04 financial years covering the economic performance of seven organic farm types including cropping, horticulture, lowland and LFA dairy, lowland and LFA cattle and sheep and mixed farming systems. The identical farm samples comprise farms that are present in both 2002/03 and 2003/04. The total number of organic farms for 2003/04, also referred to as the full farm sample data, is shown alongside the identical datasets for 2003/04.&#xD;
Summarised and detailed financial input, output, income, returns to labour and capital, liabilities and assets and some physical performance measures are presented based on current Farm Business Survey (FBS) data collection and collation guidelines. The full samples of organic farms per robust farm type are sufficiently large to give some reasonable level of confidence in the data; however, it should be noted that the organic farm samples are not statistically representative of their type, although they can be seen as a reasonable indication of farm income levels for comparable organic and conventional farms. Smaller identical farm samples should be treated more cautiously as there is a possibility for outliers (especially larger farms) to have some influence on the average results.&#xD;
An additional element of this work is the inclusion of comparable conventional farm data for the farm types shown. Each organic farm within this study was matched with an appropriate cluster of conventional farms based on the resource endowment identifiers/variables of individual organic farms. Broadly speaking, the identifiers/variables included farm type, FBS region, Less Favoured Area (LFA) status, utilisable agricultural area (UAA), milk quota holding (where applicable) and farm business size. The cluster farm data were averaged for each farm type to derive the comparable conventional farm (CCF) data based on the organic farms from the identical and full farm samples.&#xD;
Overall, the identical sample of organic farms showed a similar or higher level of net farm income for all farm types in 2003/04 than in 2002/03. On comparing the organic data with the comparable conventional data, the greatest differences in performance were seen in the LFA dairy and lowland cattle and sheep farm types where organic farms performed significantly better in 2003/04. LFA cattle and sheep farm types performed similarly to the comparable conventional farm samples. The full sample datasets compared similarly to the identical datasets for both organic and conventional farms in 2002/03.&#xD;
Gross margin data are presented for organic dairy herds on a herd size and top five performing herd basis. Cattle and sheep gross margins are shown for lowland and LFA farm types. Crops shown include winter and spring wheat, triticale, spring barley, spring and winter oats, beans, ware potatoes, sugar beet, leeks, early potatoes, winter broccoli, cauliflower and cabbage crops. Where applicable, 2002/03 gross margin data are shown alongside the 2003/04 data. Benchmarking data are shown for milk, suckler store, finishing beef and lamb production enterprises.</dc:description>
