  <dc:description>What is the Organic Grain Link Project?&#xD;
•  The Organic Grain Link project is designed to help organic arable farmers&#xD;
produce and market their crops effectively and profitably.&#xD;
•  The lead project partner is Norton Organic Grain Ltd who are supported by Saxon Agriculture Ltd and Lincolnshire Organic Producers.&#xD;
•  The project is supported for 3 years under the England Rural Development&#xD;
Programme by the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs&#xD;
(DEFRA) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.&#xD;
&#xD;
Why is the Organic Grain Link project necessary?&#xD;
•  The domestic production and consumption of organic grain has increased dramatically over a 10 year period in response to consumer demand for organic foods.&#xD;
•  Grain consumers and processors need consistent supplies of good quality raw material to support cost effective production on a year-round basis. &#xD;
•  It is vital that organic grain producers have a clear understanding of the markets that are available for their crops.&#xD;
•  Organic grain producers should be aware of the quality standards their crops need to achieve to be acceptable for each specific market.&#xD;
•  If organic farmers produce crops that are not in good demand, or fail to meet required quality standards, financial returns will suffer and difficulty may be experienced in finding market outets.&#xD;
•  Effective marketing is vital to any business – this is no less true for organic grain producers than any other producer.&#xD;
•  It is no longer good enough to assume that all organic produce is in demand – failure to meet market requirements may have a significant impact on business profitability &#xD;
&#xD;
How will the Organic Grain Link project help organic arable farmers?&#xD;
•  The project will provide crop marketing support to organic grain producers, through telephone support, newsletters, meetings and seminars &#xD;
•  Information will be provided by people who are experts in organic grain markets and have many years of first hand experience of all aspects of crop marketing&#xD;
•  The project is dedicated to supporting the organic sector, not a small addition to a non-organic business&#xD;
•  Information will be based on direct first hand involvement with the key grain consumers in the organic sector&#xD;
•  Market awareness and support provides farmers a significant opportunity to optimise returns from their cropping and improve ease of marketing&#xD;
•  Assistance in developing applications for grant funding from the DEFRA England Rural Development Programme (ERDP)&#xD;
