  <dc:description>The P losses from agriculture are controlled by natural characteristics, agricultural practices and national and international agricultural as well as agri-environmental policies. To reduce the P losses the measures should be targeted at the areas and activities that are responsible for the highest actual losses of bioavailable P. The response of an aquatic ecosystem to agricultural activities is a result of complex interactions between physical, chemical and biological processes.</dc:description>
