  <dc:description>China's organic produce was on show at the inaugural BioFach China Organic expo and conference, held in Shanghai, China, in 2007. First world manufacturers are sourcing price competitive organic ingredients from China. Much of the produce displayed Green Food labelling and/or the new Chinese national organic logo which was introduced in 2005. The packaging was of a high standard, and there was a massive variety of produce on offer, much of it  targeted at the export market. The event attracted 208 exhibitors, 88% of them from China, 9% from Europe and 3% from elsewhere; there were no exhibitors from USA, Africa or Australia. The take away message from the expo? "Import? Export? Discover your best ally in China" and "let's nourish the world organically".</dc:description>
