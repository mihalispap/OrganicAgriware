  <dc:description>Examination of the effects of various earliness strategies on yield of soybeans&#xD;
In 2011 and 2012 a field experiment was realized in Osnabrück, Northern Germany, to study the influence of different earliness strategies on the yield of soybean. This study was done in a randomized strip design with four repetitions, realizing two earliness strategies, dissolving film and fleece cover, and additionally the control variant.&#xD;
&#xD;
In both years it was possible to increase the germination rate of the plants. Besides, there were no statistically significant differences between the yield of the three variants. However, in 2012, differences between the protein concentrations could be detected. The protein concentrations of the variants which were realized with dissolving film and fleece cover, were significantly higher than those of the control variant.</dc:description>
