  <dc:description>Definition of the problem:&#xD;
In Switzerland, we can state a trend that farmer convert meadows more and more to pastures.  What could be the consequences for biodiversity?&#xD;
&#xD;
Project aims:&#xD;
Find out in what way biodiversity differs in newly established low-input pastures from high-input pastures.&#xD;
Analysis of the succession within the first six years.&#xD;
&#xD;
Methodology:&#xD;
Analysis of indicator groups in paired pastures – low-input and high input pasture – using pit-fall traps.&#xD;
Low-input pastures were newly established with different elements (trees, bushes and structural elements)&#xD;
&#xD;
Results, conclusion, state of the art:&#xD;
Communities found in low-input meadows were developing differently than in high-input meadows and were more rich in species.</dc:description>
