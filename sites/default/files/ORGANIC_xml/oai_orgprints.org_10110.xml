  <dc:description>The Ministry is seeking to encourage an expansion of organic farming with a research programme to provide information of benefit to organic farmers and to policy makers.  The lack of a reliable and effective weed control system that does not rely on herbicides, has been highlighted as the major problem in limiting the growth of organic farming in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
Studies have been made that are aimed specifically at developing organic weed control techniques.  There has also been work on non-chemical methods for dealing with weeds in conventional systems.  Research in weed biology, population dynamics, and competition modelling from conventional systems also provide valuable information for improving weed control strategies.  In addition, research into novel and improved methods of plant husbandry, plant breeding, and the application of new technology in guidance systems etc., can also make a contribution to providing better weed control in organic and conventional systems.   However, because of the diverse nature of the research it is not easy to assess the current state of the art for weed control in organic farming systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
The main objective of the present project was to identify and collate the relevant R&amp;D that has been carried out and published on weed control in organic arable and horticultural production systems.  The study was also intended to define the current state of the art in non chemical weed control, allowing recommendations to be made for future research work.</dc:description>
