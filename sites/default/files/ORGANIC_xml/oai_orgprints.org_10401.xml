  <dc:description>At the time of weaning, piglets are under many stress factors such as the end of milk immunity, separation from the mother, mixing with other animals, the adaptation to new diets and new pens, etc. Piglets usually show a non infection malabsorption syndrome response and Immunological System depression. Some bacteria such as Escherichia coli can make use of that situation and grow producing the Post Weaning Diarrhoea Syndrome. This syndrome produces an awkward situation for the productive rates and for animal welfare.&#xD;
	The cause of this disease is multifactorial and therefore it makes no sense to look for an individual solution. Homeopathic and phytotherapeutic prophylaxis, and in that case, the addition of Origanum vulgare to the piglet’s diet could improve the weaners’ health but, anyway, a slight improvement will be achieved if the stress factors are not reduced or changed.&#xD;
	Improving the management and the composition of the nourishement, better management of the creep area, avoiding fights at weaning, controlling the feed intake, keeping work organized, weaning animals with similar ages and as late as possible, offering the optimum environment for the different ages, working with trained people, etc. are key points to produce healthy weaners. All these actions can offer a small response if we evaluate them individually but they can significantly improve the Post Weaning Diarrhoea Syndrome if they are working in a synergic way.</dc:description>
