  <dc:description>Danish organic farmers experience increasing difficulties with clover soil fatigue due to continuous cultivation of clover. A solution could be to undersow barley with Italian ryegrass after ploughing of grass-clover where the barley could be used as a green crop for silage (i.e., barley harvested at the beginning of heading), and Italian ryegrass could be used for cutting in autumn. &#xD;
This method offers advantages not only for the farmer but also for the environment. When grass-clover is ploughed there is a high risk of N leaching. However, new field experiments show, that with the suggested method it is possible to reduce leaching to a minimum and simultaneously achieve a high production of roughage.</dc:description>
