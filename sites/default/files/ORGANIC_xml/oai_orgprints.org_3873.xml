  <dc:title>Screening for resistance to leaf stripe (Pyrenophora graminea) in barley</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Resistance against leaf stripe (Pyrenophora graminea )  have been described in the literature, but only little is known about the resistance in modern varieties. Investigations have been started in co-operation with Danish breeders with the objective to ensure availability of healthy seed for pesticide-free and organic growing of cereals. The results so far show great variation in susceptibility to leaf stripe. Most of the tested varieties or lines were susceptible, but some varieties had a moderate level of resistance and a few were highly resistant. The test have been made with different populations collected from Denmark but only little is known about the virulence pattern in leaf stripe.</dc:description>
