  <dc:description>The aim of this field study was to investigate interactions between gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) infection, milk performance and age in goats in order to identify animal groups with higher susceptibility to GIN. On 3 farms (farm A: n = 29, farm B: n = 33, farm C: n = 117 milking goats) fecal egg count reduction tests (FECRT) were performed in summer. All 179 milking goats were enrolled in FECRT and individual milk performance was recorded before and after FEC for FECRT. Furthermore, in early summer and autumn bulk fecal samples were cultured for every farm and GIN genera were determined.</dc:description>
