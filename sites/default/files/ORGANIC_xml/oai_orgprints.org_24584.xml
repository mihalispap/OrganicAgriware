  <dc:description>Most of the 56 organic rapeseed growers interviewed in this research acknowledged modest success in rapeseed yield (often under 500 kg/ha, on average about 800-900 kg/ha), but kept continuing cultivation because of other benefits such as good price and well functioning markets of the product, flexibility in sowing time, possibility to cultivate a temporary fallow to fight the weeds, and need for protein rich fodder for own or neighbor livestock. The main complications in rapeseed cultivation were unfavorable weather conditions, pests and insufficient nutrient levels for optimal yields. The farmers followed carefully the instructions from research and advisory institutions, but were also innovative in developing their own solutions to problems. Because of different conditions with neighboring farms, different soil types and climatic conditions, different sources of fertilizers and availability of pollinators, tailor-made solutions for every farm individually are imperative. Despite problems most farmers were optimistic and were readily investing in the future e.g. by renting and buying more field area for cultivation. Success in organic rapeseed cultivation seems to coincide with optimism, good relationships with family members and neighbors, availability of affordable fertilizers and relatively large cultivation area for efficient crop rotation.</dc:description>
