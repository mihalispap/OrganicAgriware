  <dc:description>R. sachalinensis plant extracts (Milsana&lt;l!Â», clay preparations and B. brevis were tested lor control 01 powdery and downy mildew and grey mould in organically grown grapes over three years. Milsana&lt;l!&gt; was in ali trials as effective against U. necator as sulphur, even in years with very high disease pressure. The plant extract showed also positive effects in Botrytis control. Myco-Sin&lt;l!&gt; was in ali trials as effective in controlling P. viticola as the copper containing agent FW 450. The combination 01 Milsana&lt;l!&gt;, Myco-Sin&lt;l!&gt; and B. brevis revealed the potential 01 B. brevis lor control 01 B. cinerea in grape berries, and indicated additional positive effects towards the contro I 01 U. necator. The combined use 01 these biological control agents shows strong potential lor replacement 01 copper and sulphur in organic viticulture.</dc:description>
