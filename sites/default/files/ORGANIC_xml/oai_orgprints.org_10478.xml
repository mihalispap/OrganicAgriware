  <dc:description>Yield and protein content of wheat produced under organic standards was repeatedly shown to be between 20 and 40% lower than levels achieved in conventional farming systems. This is thought to be at least partially due to insufficient N-supply to the crop later in the growing season and poor adaptation of the currently used wheat varieties to organic production conditions. To address these problems, a factorial field trial was established to study the effect of Rhizobium inoculation of clover seeds and application of compost amendments to clover swards grown prior to different varieties of wheat. Three winter wheat and four spring wheat varieties were chosen from a range of European breeding programmes. Results showed that variety choice had the greatest effect on yields, but that fertility management practices also significantly affected wheat yields and protein quality for some of the varieties. This clearly indicates that yields in organic wheat production can be significantly increased by improved variety choice and fertility management regimes.</dc:description>
