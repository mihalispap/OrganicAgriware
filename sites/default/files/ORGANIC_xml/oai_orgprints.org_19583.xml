  <dc:description>Living mulch systems may decrease pest attacks. However, the below-ground competition from the living mulch may decrease the growth of the cash crop. Here growth of white cabbage in living mulch systems and in pure stands was compared. Root pruning of the living mulch increased the above-ground biomass of white cabbage, with two prunings giving higher cabbage yields than one. Below-ground growth and competition were examined by measuring root distribution in minirhizotrons and uptake of 15N placed at different soil depths. These studies showed that the ability of mulch species to compete for resources at depth was restricted by pruning.</dc:description>
