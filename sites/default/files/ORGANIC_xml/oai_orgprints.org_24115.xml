  <dc:description>Organic agriculture demands new educational processes, to create competences on individuals transforming their lives. It is not about accumulation of knowledge, but it is interpretative, proactive and assertive knowledge and attitudes within the community context and the world movement. Education on organic agriculture should strengthen reflexive consciousness of participants and their life experiences with nature.  The pedagogic process should bring tools for internal transformation of mental structures and social tools to modify the surrounding environment.  This is achieved by working basic concepts, practical activities and artistic experiences in a dynamic and dialectic way.</dc:description>
