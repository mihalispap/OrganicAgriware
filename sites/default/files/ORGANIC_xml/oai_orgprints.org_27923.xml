  <dc:description>On-farm habitats, including woodlands, agroforestry, headlands, field margins and agri-environment scheme options such as game bird cover strips, support a wide diversity of floral and faunal resources that may provide opportunities to enhance feed provision from the range for monogastrics. There have been many biodiversity studies of these habitats and this desk study will collate these data and information to test the hypothesis that the range can contribute to the nutritional needs of pigs and poultry as part of the CORE Organic II project ICOPP.</dc:description>
