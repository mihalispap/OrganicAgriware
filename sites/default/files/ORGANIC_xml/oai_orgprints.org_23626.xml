  <dc:description>We have adapted farmer field schools for the UK to boost innovation in organic and other low-input systems by encouraging farmers to share knowledge about experimentation and supporting farmer priorities for research.  Benefits in productivity and for the environment come from improved management practices and the use of renewable resources to provide low cost and sustainable solutions.</dc:description>
