  <dc:description>A field experiment was conducted under different soil  strata in poor agricultural soil condition. Each soil stratum was treated separately with different organic material for soil fertility management. These organic materials are cow dung, sheep dung, goat dung, donkey dung, rice husks, millet husks, Acacia albida, Acacia nilotica, wood ash, house refuses, and combination of all ‘ani-cro-ber’. In the first assessment, soil structure, texture, colour, consistency, bulk density were determined in the field, while in the second assessment N, P, K, Na, Ca, OC, OM and pH were determined under specific laboratory analysis. It is believed that the use of organic materials in soil management is a good way to improve and maintain soil quality and soil fertility rehabilitation in poor agricultural soil condition.</dc:description>
