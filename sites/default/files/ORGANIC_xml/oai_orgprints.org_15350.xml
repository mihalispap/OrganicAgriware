  <dc:description>Conclusions&#xD;
Potential development of sheep husbandry in organic farming in Germany was identified as follows:&#xD;
- Optimisation of existing sheep husbandry in organic farming: &#xD;
The main problems resulting from Council Regulation (EC) No. 2092/91 are appropriate feeding and lamb breeding strategies and health management. To address these weaknesses further research activities are necessary.&#xD;
- Conversion of conventional sheep farms to organic production methods&#xD;
will only become an interesting option when the problems identified are addressed. Only then support measures will actually become an incentive to convert.&#xD;
- Introduction of sheep husbandry in existing organic farms:&#xD;
Sheep husbandry can easily be introduced in existing organic farms due to the many different uses and husbandry options.</dc:description>
