  <dc:description>Soil beneficial microbe products are allowed to apply in organic farming system as soil amendment. Effects of different organic fertilization on soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbes were analyzed in this study in order to improve fertilization technology. Simulation culture experiment was designed and operated in the laboratory to exclude uncertainties, such as environment and human operations of the organic farm. Results showed that more soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was discovered in the soil fertilized by beneficial microbes with organic fertilizer compared to single organic fertilizer treatment. Meanwhile, beneficial microbe application in soil significantly accelerated decomposition of SOC. Photosynthetic Bacterium (PSB) liquid application in soil increased soil bacterial colonies and significantly declined soil fungal colonies compared to other treatments on the 40th day. Bio-fertilizer application in soil increased the soil fungal colonies, but this effect was not significant.</dc:description>
