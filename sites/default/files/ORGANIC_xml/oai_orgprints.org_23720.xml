  <dc:description>The present study was conducted at the Dryland Technology Park ,All India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture, Biswanath Chariali Center, Biswanath College of Agriculture, Assam Agricultural University, Biswanath Chariali, District sonitpur Assam, India during 2012 -2013 with the objective to find out the efficiency of the low cost vermicomposting unit as compared to conventional units involving higher cost of construction. The experiment was laid out in a randomized block design (RBD) with 4 treatments i.e  T1: Vermicomposting with Perionyx excavates in concrete pits (Control) with dimension 2.5 m(L) X 0.91 m (B) X 0.91 m(D),T2: Vermicomposting with Perionyx excavates in low cost vermicomposting unit with dimension of 2.5 m(L) X 0.91 m (B) X 0.91 m(D),T3: Vermicomposting with Perionyx excavates in low cost vermicomposting unit with dimension of 2.5 m(L) X 1.2 m (B) X 0.76 m(D),T4: Vermicomposting with Perionyx excavates in low cost vermicomposting unit with dimension 2.5 m(L) X 1.2 m (B) X 0.46 m(D) replicated five  times. Among the 4  treatments T1 ,T2 and T3 was found to be at par in terms of quantity of vermicompost harvested. Result revealed that among the different low cost vermicomposting units T2 was efficient in terms of quantity of vemicompost harvested, vermiworms and numbers of cocoons produced followed by T3. Production of vermiwash was highest in T1 (12 to 10 L per week) followed by T2(10 to 9 L per week). Daily temperature recorded in the vermi composting tanks was initially higher and gradually decreased with the decomposition process. Benefit: Cost ratio was highest in T2 ( 6.56:1)followed by T3(4.46:1) .</dc:description>
