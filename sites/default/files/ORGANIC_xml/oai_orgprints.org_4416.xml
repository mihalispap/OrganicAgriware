  <dc:description>Two studies were carried out to assess the efficacy of diatomaceous earth as an alternative to anthelmintics in grazing ruminants.  Animals treated with anthelmintics and groups of untreated animals were included for comparison.  Cattle and sheep which received the diatomaceous earth supplement had low Faecal Egg Counts (FEC) for the duration of the experimental period, similar to animals in the anthelmintic groups.  Inclusion of diatomaceous earth in the diet of grazing ruminants may offer some benefits in controlling internal parasites.</dc:description>
