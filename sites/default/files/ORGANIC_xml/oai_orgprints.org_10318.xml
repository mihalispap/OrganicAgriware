  <dc:description>DL-3-amino-n-butanoic acid (BABA) was effective in controlling downy mildew incited by Bremia lactucae Regel in lettuce plants. The two isomers of BABA, DL-2-amino-n-butanoic acid and 4-amino-butanoic acid and its s-enantiomer were ineffective compares to BABA, while the r-enantiomer was more effective. The SAR compound NaSA and its functional analogue BTH (Bion) were also ineffective compared to BABA. In growth chambers, BABA was effective when applied as a foliar spray or as a soil drench. Effective control of the disease was apparent when BABA was applied up to 5 days before inoculation or 3 days after inoculation. A foliar spray of 125 mg/L reduced disease by 50% and full control of the disease was achieved with 500 mg/L. A soil drench with 1.25 mg /pot was required for &gt;90% control the disease. In the field, 2-4 sprays with 1g/L BABA reduced disease severity by 90% as compared to control untreated plants. BABA had no adverse effect on sporangial germination of Bremia lactucae in vitro, germination on plant leaf surface or, fungal penetration into the host. However, it prevented the colonization of the host with the pathogen.)</dc:description>
