  <dc:description>The focus of OASE has been to conceptualise the evolution of organic agriculture and its relation to the social surroundings. In the efforts to trace and analyse relations between principles related to the organic way, the project has focused on Denmark but has also t ried to integrate international dimensions. The current paper is thus the result of an investigation carried out about evolution and interpretation of organic principles in IFOAM and parts of its constituency. The first section of the paper provides an overview of the IFOAM organisational history while the second section presents perceptions of IFOAM members on Basic Organic Principles.</dc:description>
