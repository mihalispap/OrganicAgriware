  <dc:description>The Cd content of the seed samples varied between 0,27 and 1,3 mg/kg dry matter. The Cd contents of the crush samples were 56 % higher on average than those of the corresponding seeds. The content of alfa-linolenic acid of the Finnish samples was among the highest compared with results from several international studies (reference value 57,0 %, Morris 2003). The composition of fatty acids, especially unsaturated fatty acids, reported in different studies varies considerably. This variation depends mainly on differences in the examined varieties and in industrial processing treatments.</dc:description>
