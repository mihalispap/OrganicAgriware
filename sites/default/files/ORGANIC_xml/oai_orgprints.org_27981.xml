  <dc:description>Insect proteins are supposed to be valuable protein sources for monogastric animals. The partial or full replacement of soybean cake by partly defatted meal from Hermetia illucens in a diet for layers did not affect their health, feed intake, feed efficiency nor laying performance and egg weights. These results indicate that insect larvae could serve as a valuable replacer for soybean products in layers diets. However, further research on long-term feeding effects and on resulting egg quality is necessary to approve insect larvae as a practicable source of feed protein.</dc:description>
