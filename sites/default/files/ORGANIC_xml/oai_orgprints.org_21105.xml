  <dc:description>This policy brief explores the nature of training and education activities of civil society organisations and tertiary institutions in Uganda. An internet search of the training and education activities in organic agriculture in Uganda shows overwhelming indications of the hard work that is being put into educating and training Ugandans. Critical questions therefore arise: ‘What is driving these training and education programmes?’ ‘Who is running these programmes and what are their focus areas?’ and, ‘Qualitatively speaking, how effective are these programmes?’ Using the analogy of ‘train them to catch fish’, the policy brief grapples with answering these complex questions. Recommendations are made to both civil society and&#xD;
the Ugandan government on strategies to carry forward the process of growing the sector.</dc:description>
