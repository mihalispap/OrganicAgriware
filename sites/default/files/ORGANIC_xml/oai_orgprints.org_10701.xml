  <dc:description>A whole-farm case study on 32 Norwegian farms, out of which most were dairy farms, showed that animal health was better on organic farms than the Norwegian average. This is probably due to dominantly spring calving, much lower rations of concentrate and lower milk yields. Roughage yields were ca 10% lower than on conventional farms in the same district.</dc:description>
