  <dc:description>Bait spray experiments against Rhagoletis cerasi were carried out in 2005 to 2007. The&#xD;
main principle of this method is to use food (e.g. sugar and proteins) as baits for the flies&#xD;
with small amounts of insecticides, which is applied on parts of the cherry tree. Main focus&#xD;
was aimed at laboratory and field cage experiments using the commercial GF-120&#xD;
Naturalyte Fruit Fly BaitTM with the insecticide spinosad, which is registered against North&#xD;
American cherry fruit fly species in the US and Canada. Furthermore, additional bait spray&#xD;
formulations as alternatives to GF-120 were used to define the right food bait quality for a&#xD;
high attractiveness and low reproduction ability. Beyond, the negative effect on&#xD;
reproduction of flies for azadirachtin (neem) was shown. During this project, promising&#xD;
results, e.g. efficacies up to 99 % with infestation rates below the infestation threshold&#xD;
were obtained. From 2008 on, other insecticides, like azadirachtin (neem) and pyrethrine&#xD;
in an appropriate food bait mixture will be used. Questions like efficacy, adequate&#xD;
concentrations, persistence, rainfastness and practicability in commercial cherry orchards&#xD;
will be answered.</dc:description>
