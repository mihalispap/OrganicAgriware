  <dc:description>In the spring 2012 narrow plastic covered roofs were erected over 6 x 8 trees in rows of Red Elstar and Rubens apples. Three of the eight trees were sprayed with sulphur and potassium bicarbonate in case of rain, the other 5 remained unsprayed. The roofed treatments were compared to unsprayed trees, and trees sprayed intensively with sulphur and potassium bicarbonate. The aim of the experiment was to investigate if reduced leaf wetness caused by the protection of the roofs could substitute the use of fungicides.</dc:description>
