  <dc:description>In artificial rearing, calves are separated from their dam usually within 24h after birth&#xD;
and any further social contacts to the mother are prevented. Although this is common&#xD;
in practice we expect severe consequences on the health state, weight gain and&#xD;
stress response of the young calf. Two groups of calves suckled by their mother (unrestricted&#xD;
contact, n=14; contact twice daily for 15 minutes each before milking, n=15)&#xD;
were compared to two control groups that were both fed via automatic milk feeder&#xD;
(maximal six times daily, n=14; twice daily, n=14). The calves of the four treatment&#xD;
groups were kept in the same barn and cows were milked twice daily. All calves were&#xD;
weaned at 13 weeks of age. The calves were weighed weekly until 3 weeks after&#xD;
weaning. The health state of each animal was assessed daily and all veterinary treatments&#xD;
were recorded until weaning. Stress response to a long-term stressor (absence&#xD;
of the mother) was assessed by stimulation of the HPA axis by ACTH administration&#xD;
(at 11 weeks of age). For statistical analyses, linear mixed-effects models were used.&#xD;
The health state of both suckled groups was poorer (p=0.046, caused by diarrhoea),&#xD;
but the number of animals that had to be treated by a veterinarian did not differ. During&#xD;
the milk feeding period, weight gain was better in suckled calves (p&lt;0.001). After&#xD;
weaning, the weight gain of all treatment groups was diminished, especially in suckled&#xD;
calves (p&lt;0.001). Cortisol response to ACTH administration was reduced in calves fed&#xD;
via an automatic milk feeder (p&lt;0.001). The higher weight gain in suckled calves&#xD;
before weaning can be explained by the large milk amounts the calves received.&#xD;
These results suggest that suckled calves show fewer signs of chronic stress. We&#xD;
conclude that rearing without contact with the mother causes chronic stress in young&#xD;
calves in terms of desensitization of the HPA axis.</dc:description>
