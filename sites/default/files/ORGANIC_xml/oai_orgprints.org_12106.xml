  <dc:description>The present study, which is part of a broader research activity still under way,provides cost and profitability analysis with respect to organic and integrated fruit production in Italy. A comparison between the two production techniques within a static farm management framework is discussed. Production costs and profits are estimated for two case studies, the first one related to apple production and the second one related to peach and nectarine production. Both the cases refer to the area of the Northeast of Italy, which is the most important area for these types of produce.</dc:description>
