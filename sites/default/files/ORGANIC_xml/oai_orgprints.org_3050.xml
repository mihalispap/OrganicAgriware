  <dc:description>A field experiment was conducted in 1999-2001 in order to test if intercropping with other plant species with at strong scent would be able to distract clover seed weevils away from the clover seed field. Intercropping with chives, caraway, oregano or thyme did not have any effect on the number of clover seed weevils registered and white clover seed yield was not affected by any of the treatments. It is concluded, that a well-established white clover seed crop is very competitive against other plant species.</dc:description>
