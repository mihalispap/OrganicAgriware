  <dc:description>In a farmers' survey within Organic Participatory Guarantee Systems (PGS) in Soc Son Hanoi, Vietnam farmers indicated that they feel there is room for improvement, but that they are largely satisfied with the management schemes and farming systems. They gave a high score for questions related to the principles; health 74%, ecology 79%, fairness 68%, and care 71%. These results are outlined and the case is made that the organic principles are measurable and comparable. It is further argued that with a quantifiable measurement of the functioning of organic systems from the farmer we may find more ways to promote and help shape the future of the movement according to the principles.</dc:description>
