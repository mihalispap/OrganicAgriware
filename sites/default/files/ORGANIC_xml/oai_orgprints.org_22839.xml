  <dc:description>Increasingly strict legislation about fertilizer inputs and developing organic regulations are a strong&#xD;
stimulation to optimize the internal nutrient dynamics of organic arable farms. In the project&#xD;
“PlantyOrganic” , initialized by Biowad and realized at SPNA location Kollumerwaard, a challenging&#xD;
arable system is developed and tested: 100% internal nitrogen supply without input of nutrients from&#xD;
outside. In this report the design of the rotation and fertilizer scheme is presented and discussed, and&#xD;
the starting conditions in spring 2012 are documented. The NDICEA nitrogen model is used to&#xD;
explore the nitrogen dynamics. It is concluded that a 100% farm-own nitrogen supply can be&#xD;
achieved with good production levels. The 2012 results gave no reason to reconsider the rotation&#xD;
and fertilizer design, but since this was the first year of this experiment none of the crops had the precrop&#xD;
as foreseen in the design and the fertilizer used was only partly cut-and-carry fertilizer.</dc:description>
