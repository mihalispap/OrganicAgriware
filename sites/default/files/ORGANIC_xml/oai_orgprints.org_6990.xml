  <dc:description>The objectives of the current study were to examine the potential effects of distribution of sainfoin hay on nematode parasitism&#xD;
in a producing herd and to measure the consequences on milk production. The survey was performed in an experimental herd&#xD;
of 120-dairy-goat farm during a whole 9-month grazing season. Every month, 60 goats received indoors on average 1.36 kg of&#xD;
sainfoin hay for 10 days whereas the 60 remaining goats were used as controls, thus receiving the same amount of lucerne hay at&#xD;
the same time. The nutritional values of both hays were comparable except that concentrations of condensed tannins was higher&#xD;
in sainfoin than in lucerne hay, i.e. 2.52% versus 0.7% of diet DM. Intakes of the two types of hay were recorded along with&#xD;
each period. Individual faecal and blood samples were performed monthly to compare parasitological and pathophysiological&#xD;
parameters in the two groups. Milk yield, fat and protein contents were measured fortnightly. A higher consumption of hay was&#xD;
repeatedly recorded in the sainfoin versus the control group. Irrespective to dietary treatment, nematode egg excretions were low&#xD;
during the whole season. Meanwhile, egg output was significantly lowest in the sainfoin group, but the composition in nematode&#xD;
genera was similar among the two groups. Based on a semi quantitative index for assessment of faecal consistency, a lower faecal&#xD;
dry matter content was also found in goats from the sainfoin group. The two animal groups exhibited similar milk yield, fat and&#xD;
protein contents. The differences in egg excretion between the two groups might be due to higher intake of hay in the barn thus to&#xD;
low consumption of grass, a source of parasite infection, or to the effect of some secondary compounds, like tannins. Whatever&#xD;
the mechanism involved, our results suggest that a regular distribution of sainfoin hay to dairy goats might be associated with a&#xD;
reduction in parasitism with gastrointestinal nematodes, without negative consequences on milk production.&#xD;
