  <dc:description>This factsheet describes an Organic Centre Wales, supported by Farming Connect, project to benchmark organic dairy, beef and sheep enterprises. The results provide a good basis for understanding the financial contribution of individual enterprises to the farm business, as well as a better basis for price setting. In 2004/5, data from over 50 organic farms in Wales (almost 10% of the total) was collected and analysed using standard Farm Business Survey methods.  Data are presented and findings for variable costs and sales and the future for the organic market explained.</dc:description>
