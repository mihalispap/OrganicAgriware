  <dc:description>In the spring of 2002, the Danish Minister for Food, Agriculture and Fisheries initiated&#xD;
strategy work on the cultivation of authorised GM crops in Danish agriculture. The aim&#xD;
was to produce a Danish model for the co-existence of GM, conventional and organic&#xD;
crops in support of the free choice of consumers and to ensure development possibilities&#xD;
for new and existing agricultural production forms. Three groups were set up, that were&#xD;
assigned the task of presenting the scientific and legal problems as well as drawing up a&#xD;
proposal for a Danish co-existence model. These groups were the analysis group&#xD;
(working group), the legal group and the contact group.</dc:description>
