  <dc:description>The importance of organic ornamental plants (cut flowers, pot- and bedding plants, herbaceous plants, ornamental herbs, trees and shrubs) is ranging on a very low level. But the common interest is growing. Since 1996 the first European meeting on organically grown ornamental plants took place in Switzerland more and more sellers offer these plants. As well the number of newspaper articles and events occupying this subject is growing.</dc:description>
