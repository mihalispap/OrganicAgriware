  <dc:description>During the past decades, and especially since the first official publication of the Organic Regulation and Standard from the European Union in 1991, the production of high quality and environmentally responsible products has been guided through a continuous process of upgrading and adjusting to the latest developments in the global market. Despite the constant increase of the number of certified organic operations and the global market share, the Control System responsible for the Inspection and Certification of the Organic Products is striving towards maintaining the integrity and defending the future of Organic Agriculture. The emerging need of a control system, which is reliable and effective, provides the tools necessary in order to create a strategy based on the “Grassroots Theory” with the involvement of various stakeholders from the private and public sector as well as all relevant NGOs. Following a European model based on the trust on the Control System on Organics, as well as providing clear and distinct conditions for providing high quality products to consumers, it is gradually building a level of trust that is transformed into a strong lobbying tool. The role of the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements has provided substantial assistance into fulfilling the needs of the Organic Sector, as well as effective consultation on continuously improving the European Regulation and Procedures.</dc:description>
