  <dc:description>Although Ascaris suum is the most common nematode in pig farms, the on-farm transmission dynamics is not well described. Hence we performed a 1-year field study on organic pig farms, mapping egg contamination levels in pens and on pastures (dry sows, lactating sows and starters) and infection levels in animals. In conclusion, recovery of infective eggs was limited in deep litter compared to shallow litter, but many deep litter eggs were still viable.  A. suum transmission takes place both indoors and outdoors. Highly infective bedding material should be stored, composted or treated before spreading on crops and never used for pastures.</dc:description>
