  <dc:description>Although organic farming has expanded significantly in Europe in the last decade, a sectoral policy model is still missing that is able to analyse the impact of policy measures on organic farming. The use of programming models in the form of a sector-consistent farm group model seems to be a promising model approach, whereas applied general equilibrium models are regarded as less promising. An example is given for a policy impact model for organic farming. The bottom-up structure of this type of model makes it possible to analyse the impact of policy measures on farm incomes and volumes of production of organic and conventional farms at farm, regional and sectoral level.</dc:description>
