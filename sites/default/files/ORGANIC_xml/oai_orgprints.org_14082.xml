  <dc:description>Scab is still a big challenge for those apple orchards which are managed organically.&#xD;
Inoculum survives during winter in leaf litter, and sporulates in spring when&#xD;
vegetation starts. Different surveys in other regions showed that it is possible to&#xD;
reduce the presence of scab in apple orchards by removing the leave litter from the&#xD;
orchards. Different trials were carried out to understand if sanitation measures would&#xD;
also be of practical interest in organic orchards in South Tyrol. The results varied. In&#xD;
some trials, scab was reduced on the leaves up to 60%, in others no differences&#xD;
were observed. It is therefore not clear if the results justify the expense of cost and&#xD;
time for such measures.</dc:description>
