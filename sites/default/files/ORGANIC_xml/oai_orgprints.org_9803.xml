  <dc:description>In laboratory and micro-plots simulations and in a commercial greenhouse, soil ammonia (NH3) and pH were manipulated as means to control soil-borne fungal pathogens and nematodes. Soil ammonification capacity was increased by applying low C/N ratio broiler litter at 1–8% (w/w). Soil pH was increased using lime at 0.5–1% (w/w). This reduced fungi (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. dianthi and Sclerotium rolfsii) and root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) in lab tests below detection. In a commercial greenhouse, broiler litter (25 Mg ha−1) and lime (12.5 Mg ha−1) addition to soil in combination with solarization significantly reduced M. javanica induced root galling of tomato test plants from 47% in the control plots (solarization only) to 7% in treated plots. Root galling index of pepper plants, measured 178 days after planting in the treated and control plots, were 0.8 and 1.5, respectively, which was statistically significantly different. However, the numbers of nematode juveniles in the root zone soil counted 83 and 127 days after pepper planting were not significantly different between treatments. Pepper fruit yield was not different between treatments. Soil disinfection and curing was completed within one month, and by the time of bell-pepper planting the pH and ammonia values were normal.</dc:description>
