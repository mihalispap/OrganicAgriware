  <dc:description>The research needs of any applied subject are always influenced by three major groups of criteria. These are the economic/political, the societal/ethical and the technical/scientific. This is especially the case for Organic Farming which explicitly sets out to present a positively value based approach to agriculture, an activity, which has commonly become dominated by the commercial economics of an industrial society. To maintain this ethical stance Organic Farming must challenge some of the tenets of conventional economics and politics and must work within the particular societal context. Its scientific needs are then driven either by the need to increase its role in terms of market share or the need to achieve its aims more effectively in respect of product quality and/or delivery of environmental goods. In this paper I examine the current opportunities for Organic Farming in relation to the present state of farming economics and the current expectations of society, considering both food production and the delivery of environmental services which are paid from the public purse, e.g. via the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). I use these criteria to analyse what are the current primary research needs in relation to the science and ethical base of Organic Agriculture.</dc:description>
