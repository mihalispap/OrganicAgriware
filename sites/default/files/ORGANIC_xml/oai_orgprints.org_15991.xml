  <dc:description>The ERA-NET CORE Organic, conducted in 2004-2007, launched 8 transnational pilot projects, funded by the participantsâ€™ funding bodies. These projects are running for the period 2007-2010 and reached their mid-term at the end of 2008. The meeting was an opportunity to present the projects and their preliminary results at mid-term, including new research needs and how research may benefit the organic sector, and to have a discussion between project coordinators, CORE Organic Funding Body Network and other participants on experiences with transnational research arising from such projects.</dc:description>
