  <dc:description>The total organic area in the new European Union member states from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE NMS) reached more than 670 000 ha in 2004. In the organic production structure grassland and production of fodder have become the main organic crop areas. There are still many barriers to overcome to diversify organic production and to reach consumers with products that meet their expectations.</dc:description>
