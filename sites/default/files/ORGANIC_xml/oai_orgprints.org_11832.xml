  <dc:description>This paper outlines some of the key features of a Midwest organic model that could provide the foundation for a regionalized organic strategy in the US. Based on the results of several recent and on-going studies of organic fruit and vegetable production and marketing in Michigan, the paper looks specifically at the profile of Midwest organic farming, the diversified marketing strategies and portfolios of Midwest organic farmers, and the challenges and opportunities identified by wholesalers and brokers for sourcing organic produce from small family farms. Two approaches to assure the viability of the Midwest organic model are introduced.</dc:description>
