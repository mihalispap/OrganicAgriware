  <dc:description>The best application technique and application data for the treatments with Quassia extract against&#xD;
the apple sawfly Hoplocampa testudinea Klug were tested. The spraying solution was distributed&#xD;
best on the receptacle of the blossom – the place where the sawfly larvae feed before the enter the&#xD;
blossom – when the treatment was effecttuated at fading blossom with a high amount of water&#xD;
(about 500 l/ha/mTh). The addition of T/S forte, a wetting agent, could also improve the efficacy of&#xD;
Quassia treatments in a lower dose. Thus, it is recommended to apply in fading blossom with addition&#xD;
of T/S forte and high amounts of water to obtain the best effect. If the conditions for applications&#xD;
are good and the infestation is not too high, the normally recommended dose of 6 g/ha/mTh&#xD;
can even be reduced.</dc:description>
