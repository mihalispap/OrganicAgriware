  <dc:description>Preference testing is a good method for this age-group to get a decision from children. Children have fun in tasting samples and give serious answers [shown with mimic and gestic]. Preference testing with young children should only be applied, if differences in samples are big enough. Recommendation: First Sensory Profiling [panel], then difference testing [children].&#xD;
Summarized, evaluation shows no generally differences in the 4 chosen breast-feeding history types. In this study many other connections with answers of questionnaires and DONALD-data are possible, partly already done or will be evaluated in future. It seamed that the cultivation method [organic or conventional] is not responsible for the child perception.</dc:description>
