  <dc:description>Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) has a high ecological value due to the long and&#xD;
intensive flowering as well as its favorable impact on soil fertility. However, in Europe&#xD;
demand for buckwheat kernels as food is low. Therefore, the question arises whether&#xD;
cultivation of this plant could be promoted by using it as animal feed. In the current&#xD;
preliminary experiment, the extent to which buckwheat, offered in different forms, is&#xD;
consumed by dairy cows was tested in conjunction with potential effects on milk yield.&#xD;
Three groups of lactating cows were fed a silage-concentrate mixture, which either&#xD;
contained 3 kg DM/d buckwheat kernel flour (n=4), or 2.5 kg DM/d buckwheat total&#xD;
plant silage (n=3) or no buckwheat compound (control; n=4). After 4 days of adaptation,&#xD;
the experiment lasted for 10 days. During this relatively short period, neither feed&#xD;
intake nor milk yield or body condition were affected. However, the nutrient density of&#xD;
buckwheat silage was low. By contrast, the buckwheat kernel flour proved satisfactory&#xD;
as an energy concentrate.</dc:description>
