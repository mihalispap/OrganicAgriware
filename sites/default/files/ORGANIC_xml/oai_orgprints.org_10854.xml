  <dc:description>The Organic Conversion Information Service (OCIS) has been operational in Wales since 1996. In 2001 the original funding arrangements for OCIS came to an end and this review was conducted to evaluate the service and canvas farmer opinion to inform the next phase of its development.&#xD;
&#xD;
A questionnaire survey of everyone who had contacted OCIS in its first five years revealed generally high satisfaction with the helpline, information pack and on-farm advisory visits provided by the service. Farmers identified a range of extra features that would be useful, such as more information on marketing, environmental issues and conversion planning.</dc:description>
