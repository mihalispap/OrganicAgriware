  <dc:description>The story started when a state-owned enterprise wanted to implement its corporate social responsibility (CSR) program by aiding rice farmers in the district of Pomalaa, regency of Kolaka, province of Southeast Sulawesi. By collaboration with Katari, the company supported the development of organic rice by using the system of rice intensification (SRI). The program conducted a field class along one planting season, with weekly sessions. The training materials included soil ecology, organic fertilizers, planting patterns, integrated pest management (IPM), seed management, and post-harvest processing.</dc:description>
