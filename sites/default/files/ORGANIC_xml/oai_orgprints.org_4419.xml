  <dc:description>The potential of ethanolic extracts of some common medicinal plants of Ethiopia for control of late blight (Phytophthora infestans) in tomatoes and potatoes has been investigated in vitro and in vivo. The application of several ethanolic plant extracts resulted in a significant inhibition of mycelium growth (0.25% m/v) and an impairment of late blight disease severity in vivo (1% m/v). Extracts from Hagenia abyssinica, Lepidium sativum and Lippia adoensis showed the strongest suppression of mycelium growth. The application of extracts derived from the H. abyssinica gave the highest in vivo bioactivity against P. infestans on tomatoes, but no effect was noted in potatoes under field conditions. The general potential of these extracts for late blight control has been proved, while a practical application in organic crop production still requires further research.</dc:description>
