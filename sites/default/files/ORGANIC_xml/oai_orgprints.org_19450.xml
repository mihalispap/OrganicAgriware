  <dc:description>Choose of the bedding material is important especially in the Northern climate conditions, because&#xD;
the horses are kept most part of the day and year indoors during their life. Especially, the effect of&#xD;
the bedding material on the quality of the stable air is of great importance. Based on their&#xD;
properties, it seems that peat and straw pellets are the most suitable beddings for horse stables. Also&#xD;
pelleted newspaper seems to have a good potential as a bedding material.</dc:description>
