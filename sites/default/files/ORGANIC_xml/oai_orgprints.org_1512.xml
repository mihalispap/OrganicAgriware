  <dc:description>A screening programme is developed to investigate phytochemical differences in plants xposed to stress compared with non-exposed plants. The screening programme, in its resent form or in a more simplified form, can be utilized in several different areas as a preliminary broad screening. The screening programme covers the most general groups of compounds found in plants. The following groups of phytochemical compounds are included&#xD;
in the programme: Unspecific compounds, organic acids, lipids, phenolic compounds, carbohydrates, terpenoids and N-, S- and P-containing compounds.</dc:description>
