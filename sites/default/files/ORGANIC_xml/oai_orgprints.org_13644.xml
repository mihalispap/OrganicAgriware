  <dc:description>Although potassium phosphite is not registered for organic fruit production in Europe, it&#xD;
has long been regarded as a potential alternative to sulphur- and copper-containing&#xD;
fungicides. In 2005/2006 a field trial was carried out to verify the presence of residues of&#xD;
phosphoric acid over time in apples after applications of potassium phosphite at different&#xD;
time-points. No residues were present on fruits if treatments were applied before flowering,&#xD;
whereas treatments after flowering, in the summer or in autumn resulted in comparable&#xD;
residue levels irrespective of the period of application. Residues were eveneven found in&#xD;
leaves and fruits of the following years, 2006 and 2007.</dc:description>
