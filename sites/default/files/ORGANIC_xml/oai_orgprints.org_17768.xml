  <dc:description>A control method for broad-leaved dock (Rumex obtusifolius) with hot steam was tested in grasslands in Switzerland. More than 700 plants were treated with a mixture of hot water and steam at a temperature of 120°C and a pressure of 30 bar. The aim was to identify an optimum heating time, so that the plant mortality rate was more than 80 %. The necessary diesel and water consumption for the heating were measured. &#xD;
The success of the method is strongly related to the soil moisture. The results show, that the intended mortality rate of 80 % at a soil moisture of 30 % can be realized at a calculated heating time of 30 seconds. For this treatment 2.4 litre of water and 0.046 litre of diesel were needed.</dc:description>
