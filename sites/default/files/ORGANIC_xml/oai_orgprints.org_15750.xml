  <dc:description>This study focused on the formation of nisin, a 34-residue antibacterial polypeptide, and plant-derived biomolecules and their antimicrobial properties in lactic acid bacteria fermentations. The role of the genes nisB and nisC in the nisin biosynthetic pathway was investigated. Nisin was produced in M17G medium and in cabbage juice by fermenting with a wild-type Lactococcus lactis N8 and the mutant strains LAC48 and LAC67. Besides nisin, the focus was on the formation of plant-derived molecules, especially glucosinolate breakdown products in cabbage fermentation.</dc:description>
