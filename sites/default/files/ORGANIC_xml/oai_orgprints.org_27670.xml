  <dc:description>This paper discusses how the consumption of organic food can be understood as a form of hybrid communication. By describing the consumption of organic food as a form of hybridity the paper shows how different codes such as health, aesthetics and morality can be reproduced by re-entering the economic code. This process of hybridizations allows the communication to handle more complexity than had it only been coded economically. But on the other hand the hybridization also creates an increased amount of social complexity. The paper argues that in order to better understand how consumption functions systems theory provides an analytical perspective that is well attuned into the entanglement of the different logics.</dc:description>
