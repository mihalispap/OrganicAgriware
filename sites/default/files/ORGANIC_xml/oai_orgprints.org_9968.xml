  <dc:description>A review has been produced of three aspects of organic horticultural production, namely protected cropping, top fruit and vegetable transplants.  For each sector of the industry the practical problems have been discussed particularly those that may relate to conversion from conventional production and an attempt has been made to analyse the economic performance.  In an area where there are few sources of published information, the economic assesments have of necessity been based on the experiences of a small number of growers.</dc:description>
