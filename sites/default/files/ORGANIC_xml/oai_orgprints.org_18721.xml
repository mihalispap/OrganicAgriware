  <dc:description>Today in conventional food and feed production added vitamin B2 is produced almost exclusively from a GMO,1 namely the genetically modified Bacillus subtilis. Vitamin B2 applied in certified organic food and feed productions is an exception, as it is still synthesized conventionally. In fall 2007 and also recently, there has been a lack of non-GMO derived vitamin B2 on the European market, which has caused temporary supply problems for organic producers. This event triggered the political will to conduct new research in order to find alternative solutions for the substitution of synthetic vitamin B2 in organic agriculture.</dc:description>
