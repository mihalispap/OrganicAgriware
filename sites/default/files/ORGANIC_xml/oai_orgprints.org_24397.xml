  <dc:description>The world food system is broken, the most prosperous nations are experiencing epidemics related to what they eat, fresh produce is not available for some people, and farmers growing organic food face many challenges within systems that don’t always support them. A farmer and a social worker, the presenter has a unique perspective to share. This presentation puts a lens on the United States’ food system, farmers who grow organic food and what needs to happen in order to transform the food system. The central thesis is that the relationship between the farmer and the consumer is key. A prime opportunity for contact and building these relationships is at the farmers market.</dc:description>
