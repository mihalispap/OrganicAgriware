  <dc:description>From a historical point of view, it is obvious that agriculture is responsible for building the cultural landscapes of Europe. In a process of hundreds of years, the natural landscapes had been replaced by cultural ones. Of course, agriculture led to extinction of at least some mammal species, but replacing the forests by settlements with pastures, meadows, orchards, arable fields and structural elements increased the number of plant and animal species in the landscape. Several species were introduced from other continents.</dc:description>
