  <dc:description>The experimental stations at Jyndevad was established in 1939, only a few kilometres from the Danish German border. The station has a total of 90 ha of farmed land, of which 79 ha are suited for experimental purposes. The soil is very a uniform Jb1 with 72 % of coarse sand. Due to the sandy soil, Jyndevad has specialized in irrigation. At Jyndevad there are two organic crop rotation systems at a total of 12 ha. The crop rotation systems are func-tioning as a platform for other research projects.</dc:description>
