  <dc:description>Development in organic farming has been stim- ulated by farmers and consumers becoming interested in healthy food products and sustainable environment. Organ- ic agriculture is a holistic production management system which is based on the principles of health, ecology, care, and fairness. Organic development in Uganda has focused more on the crop sector than livestock sector and has primarily involved the private sector, like organic products export  companies  and  non-governmental organizations. Agriculture in Uganda and many African countries is predominantly traditional, less mechanized, and is usually associated with minimum use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and drugs. This low external input agriculture also referred to as “organic by default” can create basis for organic farming where agroecological methods are intro- duced and present an alternative in terms of intensification to  the  current  low-input/low-output systems.  Traditional farming should not be confused with organic farming because in  some cases, the existing traditional practices have consequences like overstocking and less attention to soil improvement as well as to animal health and welfare, which is contrary to organic principles of ecology, fairness, health, and care. Challenges of implementing sustainable organic practices in the Ugandan livestock sector threaten its future development, such as vectors and vector-borne diseases, organic feed insufficiency, limited education, research, and support to organic livestock production. The&#xD;
&#xD;
 &#xD;
prospects of organic livestock development in Uganda can be enhanced with more scientific research in organic livestock production under local conditions and strength- ening institutional support.</dc:description>
