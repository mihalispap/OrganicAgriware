  <dc:description>Hot water dipping is an appropriate method to protect apples against spoilage&#xD;
caused by gloeosporium rot. Tests on the varieties Topaz and Ingrid Marie at the&#xD;
OVB Jork (Germany) have demonstrated an effective reduction of spoilage from&#xD;
between 80% and 92% in charges by an infection rate of 40%. The result of an&#xD;
intensive R&amp;D process between 2002 and 2003 is the development of a praxis-tested&#xD;
big box (300 kg) dipping station. With the first Bio Dipping systems now on the&#xD;
market it has now been possible to analyse the economics of this process.&#xD;
The costs of the systems per apple farm have been calculated from the fixed capital&#xD;
costs for the system itself (including maintenance costs) and from the variable costs&#xD;
based on an average crop of 250 t gloeosporium-sensitive varieties, which would be&#xD;
treated with this process every season. The Return on Investment depends largely&#xD;
on the effectiveness of the process in reducing spoilage and on the level of infection&#xD;
within the crop, assuming that losses occur in storage. Based on an average&#xD;
effectivity of 85% and an infection rate of 10% it has been possible to calculate an&#xD;
amortisation within eight years. Higher levels of infection and a consistent effectivity&#xD;
of 85% shorten this time span significantly.&#xD;
The attractions of the hot water dipping process are in the opinion of the research&#xD;
team at the OVB Jork not merely economically convincing in terms of ROI. By&#xD;
reducing the levels of spoilage throughout the entire supply chain, it is for the first&#xD;
time possible to make a significant development in the sustainable quality&#xD;
management of organic apples, providing clear benefits for both consumer, trade and&#xD;
the grower.</dc:description>
