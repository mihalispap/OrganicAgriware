  <dc:title>Wageningen Universiteit</dc:title>
  <dc:description>Wageningen University was founded in 1918. In recent decades it has evolved into one of the world’s leading education and research centres in the plant, animal, environmental, agrotechnological, food and social sciences. The way food is grown has undergone rapid change in the last few decades. All over the world, agriculture is becoming more and more market driven, while pressures on the environment are increasing. For many years, Wageningen scientists have been aware of the ultimate importance of maintaining a habitable planet earth, as well as ensuring reliable supplies of safe, high quality food, while maintaining the biodiversity of natural habitats and conserving natural resources. Wageningen University has therefore formulated it’s mission accordingly: Wageningen University wishes to develop and disseminate the scientific knowledge needed to sustainably supply society’s demand for sufficient, healthy food and a good environment for humans, animals and plants. Recognising the importance of disseminating knowledge and expertise, we offer students from around the world a wide range of educational programmes. Wageningen University offers students from abroad a special international Master of Science Programme as well as a post-graduate programme.</dc:description>
