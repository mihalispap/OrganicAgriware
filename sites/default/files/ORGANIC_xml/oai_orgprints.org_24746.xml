  <dc:description>The aim of the trials was to test potential plant extracts for control of apple sawfly. The products Quassia-MD, NeemAzal T/S and Tracer were selected for testing. All 3 substances are allowed in organic production according to EU Regulation 837/2007, but use in Denmark requires that the products are approved by Milj√∏styrelsen as a pesticide, but none of the products have been approved until now.</dc:description>
