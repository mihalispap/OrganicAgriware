  <dc:description>A continuous dissemination process during the lifetime of a research project is important. However, it remains a challenge for many research consortia as dissemination of intermediate results might have negative consequences for publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Based on an analysis of the dissemination output of eight European research projects, we provide recommendations to researchers on dissemination tools and channels to ensure a continuous knowledge exchange and information flow. We also propose additional criteria to be considered by funding bodies when selecting and evaluating research proposals.</dc:description>
