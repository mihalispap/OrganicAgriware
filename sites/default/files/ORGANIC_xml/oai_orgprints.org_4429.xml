  <dc:description>The study was conducted as part of a EU-wide qualitative survey on consumer perception of organic products, carried out in 8 European Countries (Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Switzerland). It aimed to investigate consumer motivations and barriers related to buying organic products, in order to better understand the consumer decision-making process. In particular, the proposed paper focused on:&#xD;
&#xD;
•	the role of quality marks and certification labels on consumers’ knowledge of organic products;  &#xD;
•	those aspects which determine and facilitate consumers confidence towards organic products;  &#xD;
•	opportunities for the improvement of the communication and distribution strategy of these products.</dc:description>
