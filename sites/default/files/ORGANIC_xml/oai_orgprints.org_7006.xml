  <dc:description>Investigations were carried out for the biological control of Phytophthora nicotianae (citrus root rot) on two citrus rootstocks (Sour orange and Troyer citrange) transplanted in organic and conventional substrates, treated with the semi-commercial product Clonotri (Trichoderma harzianum and Clonostachys rosea) and Metalaxyl-M as a chemical control. Clonotri was more efficient than the chemical treatment increasing plant high and weight. Organic products (Chitosan, Quillaia, Equiseto and Clonotri) were evaluated for seed treatments as alternative to copper, for the control of P. nicotianae and Rhizoctonia solani during seed storage and germination. Clonotri (10, 20 ml/l), Chitosan (10 g/l) and Equiseto (20g/l) showed the best results. A standardization of the organic substrate based on Guanito fertilizer (poultry manure) was carried out on Sour orange and Troyer citrange seedlings and its use was also extended to Volkameriana lemon seedlings. The organic substrate with 1.5% (v/v) of Guanito was the best for the both rootstocks.</dc:description>
