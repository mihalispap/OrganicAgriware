  <dc:description>Shifting cultivation, known as ‘jhum’ in Northeast India is widely distributed upland slash and burn agricultural system. Efforts to address jhum remained challenging tasks, more so due to its shortening cycle but continued livelihoods dependency for a large population of upland communities. With organic foods gaining popularity, harmonizing jhum with Participatory Guarantee System (PGS) organic standards may provide enhanced opportunities for improved livelihoods and environmental security in Northeast India. The paper explores these opportunities and focuses on the features and characteristics of jhum that would require in meeting the PGS organic standards.</dc:description>
