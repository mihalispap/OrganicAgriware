  <dc:description>Over the past three years, codling moth populations with resistance to the Mexican isolate&#xD;
of Cydia pomonella Granulovirus (CpGV) have been found in Germany, France, Italy,&#xD;
Switzerland and the Netherlands. Andermatt Biocontrol has tested two new virus isolates&#xD;
(Madex Plus and Madex I12) which can overcome CpGV-resistance, and compared them&#xD;
in the field. Both isolates proved effective against Mexican isolate resistant codling moth&#xD;
populations, in several locations. In Switzerland, Madex Plus has been already approved&#xD;
for use.</dc:description>
