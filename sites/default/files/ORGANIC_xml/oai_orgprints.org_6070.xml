  <dc:description>A crop rotation experiment was established in 1997 at three locations representing different soil types and climates. Three factors were tested: crop rotation, catch crop and manure. Catch crop reduced nitrate leaching, but prohibited stubble cultivation. The use of catch crops resulted in increased levels of perennial weeds (E. repens) at one location, while at another; the level of C. arvense was not affected by catch crops, when compared with the use of stubble cultivation. Management of perennial weeds should include considerations of where in a crop rotation to use stubble cultivation, and this should preferably not be after a pulse crop. Catch crops are a more profitable way to manage C. arvense than stubble cultivations.</dc:description>
