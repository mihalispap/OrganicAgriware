  <dc:description>Ryania speciosa is a grove belonging to the family Flacourtiacea, located in tropical&#xD;
climates in Central- and South- America. The Indigenous population used the plant, which&#xD;
contains toxic alkaloids, against cockroaches. In the forties the ground wood was used as&#xD;
insecticide against different pests. In the first version of annex 2b from the EC regulation&#xD;
2092/91, Ryania was still listed, but it was subsequently cancelled due to its lack of&#xD;
registration as a pesticide in any European country. In organic farming, only a few&#xD;
insecticides are allowed, but in orchards there is a permanent need to control larvae such&#xD;
as coddling moth, etc. The Italian Ministry of Agriculture initiated a survey to investigate&#xD;
the possibility of developing an 'organic' pesticide based on Ryania. Basic research was&#xD;
done, working on extraction methods, synergists, spectrum of action, degradation, and&#xD;
efficacy in comparison with other modern pesticides including ecotoxicological&#xD;
investigations. Organic fruit growers hope that a company takes on Ryania to pass it&#xD;
through the registration procedure and puts some formulations on the market.</dc:description>
