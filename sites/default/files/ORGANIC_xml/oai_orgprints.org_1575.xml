  <dc:description>The World Commission (1987) pointed out that sustainable development in general is a&#xD;
prerequisite to alleviate fatal threats to human future. In this note1 it is stated that it is necessary to return to basic concepts and reflections to ensure that the aim, means, and context are remembered when radical changes to gain sustainability are designed. In particular this is the case when humanity’s social interplay (i.e., technology) with natural life support systems is in focus. Thus, the note is founded on a restatement of basics linked to the essential challenge facing post-industrial societies. In that light it is revealed that the current reactions to the challenge are insufficient because sustainability implies radical rather than marginal changes and that the radical changes inter alia imply a new design of rural - urban co-development.</dc:description>
