  <dc:description>Although the  indicator numbers were mainly quite low, there was a severe risk of transfer of pathogens to the environment, especially when household wastewater or surface run-off water from outdoor yards was poorly purified and allowed to flow into ditches and watercourses. The existence of buffer zones between fields and watercourses may reduce the numbers of faecal microbes in surface run-off water.</dc:description>
