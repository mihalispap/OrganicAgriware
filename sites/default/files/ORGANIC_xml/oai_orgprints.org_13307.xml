  <dc:description>Consumers are increasingly attentive to the social and environmental aspects of food production as evidenced by the significant expansion of certified food sales even in mainstream channels. This publication analyzes the use of certification schemes and standards such as organics, fair trade, and others as value-added products in the food markets of the U.S. and Canada. It assesses the volumes, trends, and market opportunities for these products and focuses on environmental and social certification schemes. Tropical fruits, coffee, and cocoa are the main product categories examined.</dc:description>
