  <dc:description>Plant soil and atmosphere models are commonly used to predict crop yield and environmental&#xD;
consequence. Such models often include complex modelling modules for water movement,&#xD;
soil organic matter turnover and, above ground plant growth. However, the root modelling in these models are often very simple, partly due to a limited access to experimental data. We present a two-dimensional model for root growth and proliferation. The model focuses on annual crops, and attempt to model root growth of the crops and its significance for N uptake from different parts of the soil volume.</dc:description>
