  <dc:description>In the years 2005 to 2007 a plastic cover was tested in a testing area planted with&#xD;
apricots and operated according to the regulations for organic production.&#xD;
Compared to the untreated control, fruit below the plastic cover showed decreased&#xD;
coloration. Monilia laxa infestations below the plastic cover could not be fully&#xD;
prevented, but were reduced considerably also by copper applications during&#xD;
flowering in 2007. Yield of the variant treated with copper, however, remained below&#xD;
average.&#xD;
Losses due to rot during storage were smallest with the covered variant.</dc:description>
