  <dc:description>Current regulations for organic monogastric production systems permit feed ingredients of non-organic origin, primarily due to concerns about meeting the demand for the essential amino acids methionine and lysine. However, 100 % organic diets will become compulsory in the EU from 1st January 2015, so there is a need to develop feeds which will supply the required level of nutrients and support high animal health and welfare. This paper reports on feeding trials carried out with broilers in the UK to investigate the impact of three 100 % organic diets: a control diet with globally sourced ingredients, a diet based on locally sourced (i.e. within Europe) organic ingredients, and a diet based on locally sourced organic ingredients and algae. The results of the summer and winter trials showed that there was no significant difference in bird weights between the three diets, indicating that using locally sourced and locally sourced with algae feeds do not impact on broiler productivity.</dc:description>
