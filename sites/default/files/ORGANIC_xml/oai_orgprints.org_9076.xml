  <dc:description>Co-existence is defined as the farmers being able to choose between conventional, organic and genetically modified (GM) crop production, in compliance with the relevant legislation on labelling rules and purity standards. Genes of cultivated plants spread in time and space through pollen and seed dispersal, and in addition handling during transport and processing may also disperse seeds. Consequently, suitable measures during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage, and processing are necessary to ensure co-existence.</dc:description>
