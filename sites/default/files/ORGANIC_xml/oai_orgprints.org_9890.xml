  <dc:description>Two historic (Red Fife and Marquis) and two modern (5602HR; AC Barrie) wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars were assessed to determine if cultivar mixtures provided a benefit to grain yield and disease and weed suppression in Manitoba over 3 site-years.  5602HR was the highest yielding sole cultivar while Marquis and AC Barrie were the lowest yielding sole cultivars. Red Fife yielded similar to 5602HR in several cases. Orthogonal contrasts across all site-years showed that 3 and 4 cultivar mixtures yielded similar (P&gt;0.05) to 5602HR, the highest yielding monocrop.</dc:description>
