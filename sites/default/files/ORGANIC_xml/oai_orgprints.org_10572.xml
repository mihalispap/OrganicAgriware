  <dc:description>Early cut organic grass silage (roundbales) was compared with silage harvested 17 days (180 daydegrees) later in a continuous production experiment with 32 Norwegian Red dairy cows in early lactation. The experiment was carried out in Bodø, Norway. A half of the&#xD;
cows received a feed ration with 40% concentrates (H), and the other half 10% (L) on an annual energy basis. Feeding early cut silage of an organic ley increased feed intake, milk yield and milk protein concentration compared with normal cut. Left-overs of concentrates were a problem in the experiment and ways to improve the palatability of&#xD;
on farm produced cereals have to be developed. Early cut crop yields were only about half of the crop yield at normal cut. Therefore early cut may only be recommended to farmers in northern Norway when acerage is not a limiting factor.</dc:description>
