  <dc:description>A grazing study was performed in 2006 over three two-week periods in May, June and August at the organic research station Rugballegaard, Denmark, where a herd of 48 Holstein dairy cows was split into four groups of 12 cows. Each group grazed one of four swards: 1) lucerne, 2) red clover, 3) white clover and 4) white clover with chicory, all four in mixture with perennial ryegrass. Milk and grass samples were analyzed to study the effect of each sward type on milk composition as well as seasonal variations.</dc:description>
