  <dc:title>Diversity of weeds - the role and management in arable ecosystems</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Weed management</dc:subject>
  <dc:subject>Biodiversity and ecosystem services</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The aim of the project is to assess the advantages and disadvantages of diverse weed flora in arable land. Weed species will be ranked according to their harmfulness for crop production and, on the other hand, their positive role in arable ecosystems. &#xD;
&#xD;
The composition of weed flora can be manipulated e.g. with crop rotation and by abstaining from use of herbicides. The study focuses on the possibilities to enhance the positive interactions between flora and fauna by adjusting the cropping practices in the farm. Different types of fallows and their management are studied. &#xD;
&#xD;
Recommendations to manage the diversity of weed flora at farm level will be given.</dc:description>
