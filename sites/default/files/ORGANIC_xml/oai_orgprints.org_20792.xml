  <dc:description>The relationship between animals and humans is important for animal husbandry and welfare. Loosehousing and grazing systems with low management input often result in frail relationships between humans and animals. This study investigated whether a positive handling, applied during the first days of the animalsâ€™ life, had a calming and stress reducing effect on suckler beef calves at slaughter.</dc:description>
