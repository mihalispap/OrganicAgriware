  <dc:description>There is currently limited evidence for differences in nutritional value and ‘healthiness’ between organic and conventional foods. While organic standards aim at minimizing antibiotic and/or pesticide residues they have been described as a potential source of high mycotoxin levels, and bacterial diseases or parasites. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of rat feeds based on the organic, low input and conventional crops on the rats’ immune system function. Preliminary results obtained indicate a potential immunomodulatory effect of ‘low input’ foods that is not observed in rats fed conventional and organic diets.</dc:description>
