  <dc:description>‘Topaz’ was the mostly planted apple variety with scab resistance in the recent years. It took only a&#xD;
few years for this variety to get that importance in organic orchards. New apple varieties always&#xD;
should be tested on different rootstocks, because there is an individual relationship between varieties&#xD;
and rootstocks. The apple varieties ‘Topaz’, ‘Rubinola’ and ‘Rosana’ were tested on the rootstocks&#xD;
‘M 26’,‘M 9’, ‘JOHA’, ‘P 22’ and ‘M 27’. ‘Topaz’ showed the best results concerning yield and&#xD;
fruit size on ‘M 9’. ‘Rubinola’ which is a strongly growing variety was better on the rootstock ‘JOHA’.&#xD;
The decision which rootstock is the best also depends on soil and water conditions.</dc:description>
