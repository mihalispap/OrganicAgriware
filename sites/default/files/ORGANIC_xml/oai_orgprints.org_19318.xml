  <dc:description>The consumer demand for environmentally friendly, chemical free and healthy products, as well as concern regarding industrial agriculture’s effect on the environment has led to a significant growth of organic farming. On the other hand, organic farmers are becoming interested in direct on‐farm energy production which would lead them to independency from fossil fuels and decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from the farm. In the presented work, the idea of biogas and bioenergy production at the organic farm is investigated. This thesis is devoted to evaluate such a possibility, starting from the characterization of raw materials, through optimizing new processes and solutions &#xD;
and finally evaluating the whole on‐farm biorefinery concept with the help of a simulation software.</dc:description>
