  <dc:description>The present study is part of the project “Public Policies and Demand for Organic Food: An International Comparison of Policy Effects and Policy Determinants” (COP). It is carried out in WP II that concerns the supply-side policies and demand. In the WP it is an initial task to formulate a theoretical approach as the conceptual framework to be used in comparative studies. The present study will be the foundation for the conceptual framework. It investigates contributions from various economic theories and extracts core theoretical fragments into a framework suitable for analysing the evolution of organic agriculture. In the conclusion the study is presenting a basis for indicators that can be used for comparative studies. It is underlined that the indicators are tentative and that they have to be tested and adjusted in future studies.</dc:description>
