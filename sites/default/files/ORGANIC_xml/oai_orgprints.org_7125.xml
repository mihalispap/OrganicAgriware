  <dc:description>Abstract - UK committed organic consumers are reported to be about 23 per cent of consumers and account for 84 per cent of organic sales.  This paper compares the committed organic consumer who is also a member of the UKâ€™s national charity for organic growing (HDRA), to committed organic consumers in the wider UK population.  Broad parallels were found between these two groups of consumers although there were differences in purchasing drivers as environmental issues were relatively more important to HDRA members than other committed organic consumers. There was also a higher prevalence of vegetarianism and gardening in the HDRA sample. Yet consumer preferences are dynamic and there is perhaps no single, stereotypical, organic consumer.</dc:description>
