  <dc:description>In organic production in Denmark, no pesticides are allowed. The need for alternative pest control is therefore large. Apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) cause big crop losses in apples. Sawflies infest fruitlets and cause these to drop prematurely after which the pests pupate in the topsoil.&#xD;
&#xD;
Combined production of hens and fruit trees is a subject often discussed in organic fruit production in Denmark. The feeding poultry may reduce the population of pests, which stay in the soil as a part of their life circle. Yet, very little research has been carried out on this type of production system.</dc:description>
