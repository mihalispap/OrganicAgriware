  <dc:description>Two field experiments were carried out in winter wheat to determine the optimal intensity and timing of weed harrowing. Each experiment was designed to create a series of intensities by increasing the number of passes at varying growth stages. Visual assessments and digital image processing were used to assess crop soil cover associated with weed harrowing. The study showed that winter wheat responded differently to weed harrowing at different growth stages. In autumn, the crop was severely damaged due to high degrees of crop soil cover and poor recovery resulting in crop yield losses in the range of 7 % to 22 %. In early spring, the crop showed some variability in the ability to recover from soil cover. The best results in spring were obtained at growth stage 22 (BBCH). Increasing number of passes resulted in increasing crop yields in the range of 2 % to 5 % and increasing degrees of weed control in the range of 22 % to 62 %. The role of digital image analysis in future weed harrowing research is discussed.</dc:description>
