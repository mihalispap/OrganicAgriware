  <dc:description>Recent developments in organic farming and consumption show dynamic growth in markets; new uptake of Organic Agriculture by farmers, however, has been slow. Hindrances appear to be production problems or lack of trust by the farmers that organic methods can solve farming problems, such as fertilization, plant protection, animal health, efficient use of workforce, marketing diversity etc. While in some cases those problems can be solved through learning existing and regionally practiced methods, innovations are imperative to make organic farming competitive and a viable alternative farming system.&#xD;
OFIA, the Organic Farming Innovation Award, part of the Organic World Congress, highlights outstanding innovations and publishes priorities for innovative research.</dc:description>
