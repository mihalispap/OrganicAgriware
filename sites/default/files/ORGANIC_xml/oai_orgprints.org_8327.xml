  <dc:description>A questionnaire survey was conducted at the university hospital in Trondheim, Norway in December 2005. In relation to former questionnaires conducted at the hospital, patients and guests were much more satisfied with the food served, especially potatoes and vegetables. Patients and guest express that food is important for their health and well-being. Good taste, appearance and right nutrition were understood as important qualities of food. The absence of pesticides, artificial fertilizers and preservatives in food were ranked as more important than organic production of food. About 80 % of the respondents were positive or really positive to the use of organic food at the hospital.</dc:description>
