  <dc:description>This case study reviews the economic, social, and environmental benefits associated with organic agriculture in the United States. Measurable impacts are quantified by comparing indicators of benefits in counties with organic farms and counties without. Statistical differences across counties with and without organic farms provide preliminary evidence that organic farms may generate a variety of direct and indirect benefits. Of 36 indicators tested across a range of economic, social, and environmental benefits, 26 favor organic systems, three favor conventional systems, and seven are neutral. Even though organic farmers are not a large percentage of the total number of U.S. farmers, they may be influencing mainstream agriculture to shift toward greater sustainability.</dc:description>
