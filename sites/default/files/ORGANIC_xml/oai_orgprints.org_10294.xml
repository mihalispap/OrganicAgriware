  <dc:description>Sheepdrove Organic Farm wanted to know whether the performance of the Lloyd Maunders (757) birds would differ from that of their current breed the Maurice Millard (257) and whether chicks sourced from an organic parent flock would perform differently to those from a conventional parent flock.&#xD;
An experiment was undertaken using two different sources of day old chicks, 1000 day old Maurice Millard (257) and 1000 day old Lloyd Maunders (757). These chicks were then put through the Sheepdrove (SOF) organic production system and 30 random birds were weighed every week until depletion, at 11 weeks.</dc:description>
