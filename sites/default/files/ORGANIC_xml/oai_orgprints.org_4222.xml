  <dc:description>Based on a comprehensive description of a recently published Decision Support System (WECOF-DSS) for weed management in organic winter wheat (http://www.wecof.uni-bonn.de), the potential of these tools for application in organic crop production is discussed. WECOF-DSS offers site-specific recommendations on cultivar choice, mechanical control, crop rotation and crop management for efficient weed control. Although Decision Support Systems are neither able to replace the decision maker nor to reflect all possible site conditions, the educational character of these tools is expected to result in an increasing use for specific objectives, e.g. high quality cereal production, also in Organic Agriculture.</dc:description>
