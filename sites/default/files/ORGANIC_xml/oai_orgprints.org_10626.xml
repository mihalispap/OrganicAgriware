  <dc:description>The overall aims of organic and low input crop production include the economically viable and environmentally sound production of high quality food and feed. Technological bottlenecks in such systems include insufficient and instable yields and in some instances unsatisfactory processing, sensory and/or nutritional quality of the final product. Recently, concerns have also been raised that the intensive use of manures may lead to increased risk for contamination of food by enteropathogenic micro-organisms. Crop production in low input systems is based on key pillars, i.e. (i) a fertile soil which provides sufficient capacity to allow for plant growth while preventing soil-borne diseases, (ii) high quality, disease-free seeds and plant material, (iii) a crop-specific soil fertility management to provide sufficient nutrients for optimum plant growth, and (iv) adequate crop protection techniques to prevent damage due to noxious organisms. In the QLIF project we develop improved component strategies to overcome technological bottlenecks in annual (wheat, lettuce, tomato) and perennial (apple) crop production systems. In this paper we report the progress achieved so far.</dc:description>
