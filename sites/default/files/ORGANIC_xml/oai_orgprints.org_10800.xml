  <dc:description>This factsheet covers financial performance of upland organic beef and sheep production.  Survey data illustrates that while organic farms can achieve similar incomes to conventional, the finances for both organic and conventional groups are at best marginal, and the models illustrate the importance of support payments. Organic premium prices are important to maintain relative incomes, but are less so here compared with dairy and arable holdings. The main factors that will influence performance are the increased role of cattle, with implications for housing and winter feed provision, as well as the emphasis on closed flocks and herds and increase on feeds produced on farm to avoid purchasing expensive conserved forage. In addition, upland farmers should consider whether agri-environment payments should contribute to income.</dc:description>
