  <dc:description>The poster explores the meaning of organic and local food and how closely they are related in the mind of consumers and producers of organic food, drawing on focus group discussions and laddering interviews with 181 consumers and 33 producers. The results show that both groups associate organic food with local trade and see this as an important value. It is concluded that in the complex organic food networks both producers and consumer have to balance localness with other values and constraints when making decisions about where to buy or where to sell their organic products.</dc:description>
