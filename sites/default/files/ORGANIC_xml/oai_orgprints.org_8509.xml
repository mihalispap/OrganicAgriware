  <dc:subject>Air and water emissions</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Yöni leaching field  (owned by the MTT Agrifood Research Finland) is situated in south-western Finland (60° N 23° E). The soil type of the field is clay, with four percent of organic C in the plough layer. There are six plots, 0.5 hectares each. Two plots have been under organic farming since 1993, two plots are under conventional farming and two plots are under natural grassland. The volume of the water from drainage pipes of each plot is measured automatically and flow-weighted water samples are taken by hand. Surface runoff is conducted to the same measurement system so that the runoff represents the total runoff from the plots. There are four other plots under organic and four plots under conventional farming, but the drainage system does not allow the measure-ment of runoff from these plots.</dc:description>
