  <dc:description>Organic agriculture offers solutions for various key problems currently faced by the agro-food sector. This includes challenges such as adapting to climate change or increasing food security. To cope with these, an effective innovation system is needed. The framework conditions for innovation in the organic agro-food sector, however, do not adequately reflect the potential that lies within it.&#xD;
This study’s goal is to identify starting points for improving how the interests of the organic agro-food innovation system are represented in Germany. In order to achieve this, the sector’s innovative ability and innovation requirements were analysed. Another focus was on the status quo of the research relating to the organic agro-food sector and the overall framework for research funding.</dc:description>
