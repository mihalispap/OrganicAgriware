  <dc:description>Field mice (Microtus arvalis), wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and root voles (Arvicola&#xD;
terrestis) constitute a big threat to the organic apple orchards in South Tyrol. The use of&#xD;
rodenticides on the fields is not allowed in organic farming. The fruit growers rely on the&#xD;
help of different natural predators. If populations increase, the possibility of trapping and&#xD;
gasifying with equipment which produces carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide remain.&#xD;
Both methods are problematic. Trapping requires skill and time. Gasifying is not&#xD;
unproblematic to the health of the user. Recently a device has been imported which is&#xD;
used successfully in the United States to control different soil-dwelling rodents. In the&#xD;
orchards of South Tyrol, various field trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
‘Rodenator’ in controlling field mice.</dc:description>
