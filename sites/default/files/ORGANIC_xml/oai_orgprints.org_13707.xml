  <dc:description>Resistance of codling moth against Cydia pomonella granulovirus (CpGV) products has&#xD;
alarmed growers, extension services, the CpGV producers and the scientific community.&#xD;
During the last two years many activities were initiated in Germany and in Europe to&#xD;
understand this phenomenon and to overcome this problem. Meanwhile, first important&#xD;
results about the distribution, mode of inheritance and the efficacy of novel CpGV isolates&#xD;
overcoming CpGV resistance became available. This contribution will provide an overview&#xD;
about the different developments and the progress made towards an improvement of&#xD;
CpGV application in the future.</dc:description>
