  <dc:title>Use and efficiency of public support measures addressing organic farming</dc:title>
  <dc:subject>Policy environments and social economy</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>For more than two decades, organic farming has been supported through policy measures which contribute to the growth of the organic sector in the European Union. However, the degree and type of support for organic farming differs substantially between Member States. Against this background, this study aims to document and assess the public support by describing, reviewing and categorising the instruments and measures used and levels of support offered. It identifies and analyses important issues surrounding the implementation of public support with a view to putting forward conclusions relevant for the future development of the policy.</dc:description>
