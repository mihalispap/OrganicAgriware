  <dc:description>Quality compost can have a positive effect on soil fertility and plant growth and health.&#xD;
This positive effect is not only observable in the laboratory, but also by growers.&#xD;
Phytopathological problems could be solved with the use of compost.&#xD;
Durable success can only be obtained if a quality management is resolutely followed.&#xD;
Further research is needed to optimize the quality management of compost production and&#xD;
utilization. For example, very little is known about the long-term effect of the different composts on soil fertility and disease receptivity.</dc:description>
