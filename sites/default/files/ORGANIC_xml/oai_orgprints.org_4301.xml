  <dc:title>The effect of different mulches on the growth and yield of organically grown strawberry</dc:title>
  <dc:creator>Kivijärvi, P.</dc:creator>
  <dc:subject>Fruit and berries</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Different mulches were studied in field trials over a three-year period under organic production in Mikkeli and Ruukki. The soil type was coarse mineral soil rich in humus. In June 2000, organically produced strawberry plants, cv. Jonsok, were planted in four replicates in double rows, 10 plants/plot, 45 cm apart. The mulching materials were black plastic, flax fibre mat (woodchips+buckwheat husk in 2002), green mass, straw, buckwheat husk, birch woodchips and pine woodchips.</dc:description>
