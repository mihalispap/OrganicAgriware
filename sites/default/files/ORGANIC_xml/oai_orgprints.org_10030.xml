  <dc:description>Infestation with gastro-intestinal nematodes in small ruminants can cause server economic losses and endanger animal welfare. The development of organic farming systems, the increased public awareness for drug residues in agricultural products and the development of resistant strains of parasites have enforced the search for sustainable alternatives. The aim of this paper was to provide information about endoparasite infecting small ruminants, to give an overview of the legal background and to investigate alternative control strategies and treatments, discussing them on overall viability. The main section has been divided into a part of  non-chemotherapeutical control strategies and alternative anthelmintic treatments.&#xD;
The conducted research has revealed the major potential to be within the field of non-chemical options. Biological control, effective pasture management, selective breeding, enhanced nutrition and the administration of bioactive forages were discussed and found to hold numerous options. The investigation of alternative anthelmintic treatments reviewed phytotherapy, homeopathy and copper-oxide wire particles. Phytotherapy was examined at in detail and found to hold future potential, indicating a strong need for scientific verification of the potential of many plants. In conclusion this paper shows possibilities and limitations in the area of alternative anthelmintic treatments as well as in non-chemical control options and outlines future research fields.</dc:description>
