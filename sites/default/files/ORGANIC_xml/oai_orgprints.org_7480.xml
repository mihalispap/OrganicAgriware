  <dc:description>In this study the effects of intercropping on the turnip root fly, Delia floralis Fall. (Diptera: Anthomyiidae), was studied in an intercropping system with cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and red clover (Trifolium pratense). Both the effects on egg laying, and the effect of natural enemies was studied. To overcome the problem of competition in the intercropping system, different understorey crops were evaluated with the aim to find species that have a low competitive force on cabbage. The possibility to minimize competition further with root pruning of the understorey species, was also investigated.</dc:description>
