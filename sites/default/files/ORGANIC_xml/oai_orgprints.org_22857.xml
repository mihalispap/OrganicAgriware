  <dc:description>There is a growing realisation that only the adoption of ecological and sustainable farming practices can reverse the declining trend in farm productivity in the state of West Bengal, India.&#xD;
The paper is on how a small holding (3.8 acres) family farm in a remote dry land area in India demonstrates what can be achieved by way of love for land and nature, self-determination, innovation and hard work. The educated farm family has neatly woven traditional knowledge and modern improvements in agricultural science for developing their organic farm and sustenance of nature. The income from the farm meets their domestic and social needs. Their child goes to one of best private English medium school. There have been noticeable positive changes among the neighbouring farmers, soil and ecology.</dc:description>
