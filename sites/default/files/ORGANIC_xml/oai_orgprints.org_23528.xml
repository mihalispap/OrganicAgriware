  <dc:description>Organic UE Regulation No 889/2008 states that, in the choice of breeds or strains, account shall be taken of the capacity of animals to adapt to local conditions, their vitality and their resistance to disease. Preference is to be given to indigenous breeds and strains. Maremmana is a very rustic and long-lived Italian cattle breed, which seems to be the direct descendant of Italian aurochs (Bos primigenius) (Giorgetti et al., 2009). Selection has always been directed towards disease resistance and adaptation to the harsh environment, where Maremmana cattle live, and generally these cattle never are treated against parasites (Martini, 2001). &#xD;
Maremmana cattle can graze all the year, utilizing, in the summer and winter periods, the Mediterranean scrub as source of food and refuge.&#xD;
Rearing system, quality of the pasture and possible concentrate integrations can influence the quality of meat and its fatty acid composition. The aim of this research is to compare the fatty acid muscle composition of Maremmana bullocks reared in different fattening systems.</dc:description>
