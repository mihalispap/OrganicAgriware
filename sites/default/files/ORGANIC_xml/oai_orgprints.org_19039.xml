  <dc:description>Two different scenarios of biogas production based on  energy crops and manure and one scenario where the biogas production is combined with bioethanol production were evaluated with socio-economic analysis. The products from the biogas plants are heat and electricity as well as organic fertilizer. The socio-economic analysis compares the scenarios with a Danish organic farming reference scenario. There are several levels of analysis, where different external aspects are added in each level, e.g. externalities such as savings in CO2-emissions by replacing fossil fuels. The competition between use of land for bioenergy or for food is evaluated.</dc:description>
