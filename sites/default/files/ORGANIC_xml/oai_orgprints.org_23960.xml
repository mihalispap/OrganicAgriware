  <dc:description>Western Australia (WA) has maintained a moratorium on the growing of genetically modified crops since 2003. An exemption was granted in 2008 for growing GM cotton only in a specified remote region of the state. A general exemption was declared in 2010 for growing GM canola anywhere in WA. In a public review, over 400 submissions were received by the government with over ninety percent arguing for retaining the ban on GM crops, while Monsanto, Dow Agrosciences and the Grain Research and Development Corporation argued for lifting the moratorium. Many submissions argued that segregation of GM and non-GM crops would fail and that the doctrine of “mutual co-existence” was unsafe. In the first year of GM canola in WA, the certified organic mixed farm of Steve Marsh was contaminated with GM canola seed which was allegedly dispersed from a neighbouring farm which planted GM canola in 2010. Marsh lost his organic certification due to GM contamination. Marsh has sought redress by consensus and via the courts.</dc:description>
