  <dc:title>Organic farming’s role in European agricultural and environmental strategies</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>"Organics" in general</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>European agricultural and rural development policy goals are increasingly compatible with those of organic farming, and organic farming has a significant potential contribution to make in many areas of policy. In particular, organic farming can contribute to, and is supported by, all four axes of the rural development programme 2007-2013, but a cross-axis approach is needed – this represents an opportunity for formally integrating national/regional action plans in member state rural development programmes. But consideration needs to be given to some key questions about the role of markets and stakeholders, and care should be taken that institutions do not 'take over' the organic movement and lose the diversity and inspiration that comes from the grassroots.</dc:description>
