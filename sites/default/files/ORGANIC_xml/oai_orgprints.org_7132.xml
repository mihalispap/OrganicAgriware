  <dc:description>The challenge that the organic sector faces is clear; it needs to grow. But it needs to do so in a balanced fashion, whereby what the producer supplies exactly matches consumer demand. We have to know what the consumer wants and when, and producers have to be willing to adjust their production accordingly. Additionally, new chain structures are required that can supply products efficiently at a low cost price, and with sufficient attention to quality and food safety. These are precisely the aspects that were focused on in the 28 projects of the Dutch co-innovation programme ‘Professionalizing organic sales chains’, which ran from 2001 through 2005.</dc:description>
