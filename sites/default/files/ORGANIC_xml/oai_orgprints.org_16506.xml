  <dc:description>Organic agriculture, as an adaptation strategy to climate change and variability, is a concrete and&#xD;
promising option for rural communities and has additional potential as a mitigation strategy. This article&#xD;
is a short review of this topic. Adaptation and mitigation based on organic agriculture can build on wellestablished&#xD;
practice because organic agriculture is a sustainable livelihood strategy with decades of use in&#xD;
several climate zones and under a wide range of specific local conditions. The financial requirements of&#xD;
organic agriculture as an adaptation or mitigation strategy are low. Further research is needed on yields in&#xD;
organic agriculture and its mitigation and sequestration potential. Other critical points are information&#xD;
provision and institutional structures such as market access.</dc:description>
