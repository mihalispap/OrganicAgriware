  <dc:description>Combined production of broilers and fruit trees is a subject often discussed in organic fruit&#xD;
production in Denmark. Very little research has been carried out on this type of production&#xD;
system. In organic production in Denmark, nearly no pesticides are allowed, so the need&#xD;
for alternative pest control is large. Apple sawfly (Hoplocampa testudinea) and pear midge&#xD;
(Contarinia pyrivora) cause big crop losses in apples and pears respectively, in unsprayed&#xD;
organic fruit production. Both insects infest fruitlets and cause these to drop prematurely&#xD;
after which the pests pupate in the topsoil. In the present experiment a research orchard&#xD;
with the varieties ‘Discovery’ and ‘Conference’ were used as outdoor area for broilers to&#xD;
minimise the population of sawflies and pear midges, and to reduce the need for weeding&#xD;
and manuring. The trees were kept unsprayed. Fruit yield and fruit quality were assessed&#xD;
at harvest. White sticky traps were placed in the test area in order to measure the&#xD;
occurrence of sawfly over time. The infestation of pear midge was investigated counting&#xD;
the infested fruitlets in clusters on trees at the centre of the plots. The catch of apple&#xD;
sawflies was reduced in the combined apple and broiler production, but no significant&#xD;
effect on the yield or the fruit quality was seen. Experiences from on-farm research show&#xD;
that combining fruit and egg-production is one way to reduce the problem with apple&#xD;
sawfly, but poultry alone is not a sufficient way of controlling sawflies. The welfare and&#xD;
health of the broilers were excellent under fruit trees.</dc:description>
