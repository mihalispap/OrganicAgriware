  <dc:description>This study aims to understand the process of conversion from conventional to organic farming in Canada.   Specifically, it looks at what factors have affected this decision and if this production system improved the prospects for sustainability. In order to achieve these objectives this study uses a socio-ecological approach and focuses on organic farmers in Ontario. Besides including a bibliographic review, organic agricultural leaders were surveyed and life story interviews were conducted with producers. The results showed that the decision to become organic is influenced by the type of farmers, their context, and their rationale for conversion. The reasons for converting to organic depended not only on economic factors, but also socio-cultural and institutional parameters. The conversion was associated with a change of values towards protecting the environment and improving farmersâ€™ lifestyles. This model of development doesn't entirely attain sustainability. In order for that to occur, the harmonization of the Canadian organic farming system requires a political solution, which humanizes the complex system of interests for organic producers and shows the potential contribution of organic farming to the achievement of sustainability goals.</dc:description>
