  <dc:description>The losses of P and faecal microbes from outdoor paddocks are possible to decrease by removing&#xD;
dung, choosing the right floor materials and adding of the P-binding material into the surface layer&#xD;
of the floor. In the present study, sand retained more P and faecal coliforms than woodchips. The&#xD;
concentrations were lower in percolation water compared to surface runoff water, since the floor&#xD;
materials retained P and sieved coliforms. Addition of Fe-containing amendment into the sand floor&#xD;
decreased P concentrations and possibly also numbers of faecal coliforms in percolation water.&#xD;
More research is, however, needed to obtain the right amendments and suitable amounts.</dc:description>
