  <dc:description>Soil tillage modifies environmental conditions of soil microorganisms and their ability to release nitrogen. We compare the influence of reduced tillage (RT) and mouldboard ploughing (MP) on the soil microbial functioning in organic farming. In order to connect soil structure generated by these tillage systems on the soil microbial biomass we adopt a particular sampling scheme based on the morphological characterisation of the soil structure by the description of the soil profile. This method reveals the influence of soil structure on soil microbial biomass and allows a more precise assessment of the impact of tillage managements on the soil microbial functioning.</dc:description>
