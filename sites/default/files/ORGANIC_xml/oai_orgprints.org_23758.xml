  <dc:description>The message is about the first PGS experience in Kyrgyzstan, which started in one village last year as an organic area (we call it organic aimak). Having no experience and based only on knowledge gained from IFOAM papers solely and OLC trainings, on enthusiasm of Federation and Bio Service staff, the project was not a success in the first year. In 2014, the FOD started organic aimak project in 3 ore villages. But there are lots of problems and challenges that shall be addressed to IFOAM and organic experts. These are: fertilizers and biological preparations for pest and disease management, relations of organic producers with consumers, PGS certification.</dc:description>
