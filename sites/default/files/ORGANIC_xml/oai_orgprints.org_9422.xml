  <dc:description>One of the objectives of the research project "Cows with calves" ('Kalveren bij de Koe') is to develop a rearing method that gives the natural bond between mother cow and calf a function. At the same time the rearing method also needs to be ﬁnancially and practically viable. In order to assess the applicability of rearing cows with calves a wide range of parameters was monitored: liveweight development of calves, behaviour of animals that suckle or suckled as a calf, milk production, calf milk consumption and animal health. These data and experiences were used to try and deﬁne the best conditions for rearing cows with calves.</dc:description>
