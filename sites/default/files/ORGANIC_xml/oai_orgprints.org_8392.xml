  <dc:description>This report was presented at the UK Organic Research 2002 Conference. On organic dairy farms, computer simulation models can be used to predict more rapidly and at less cost than field trials the outcome of changes to management strategies or physical resource inputs. Such models need to be validated with data from existing organic dairy farms to ensure that the predictions made are realistic. As part of a larger organic dairy farm modelling project, this study will use data from 2 contrasting organic dairy systems at Ty Gwyn research farm, to validate a whole farm dairy system model developed by the Scottish Agricultural College. The model will be used in future work to identify the most productive and resource use efficient organic dairy systems across a range of farm locations and resource availabilities.</dc:description>
