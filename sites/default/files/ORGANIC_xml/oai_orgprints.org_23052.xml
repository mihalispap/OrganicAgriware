  <dc:description>This report concerns the analysis of successful high-value products as case studies in each of the three meat categories: chicken, beef and pork. The main objective of our study was to identify strategic groups within the meat market, in which the new, high-value organic meat products were going to perform. The strategic group analysis also serves as a benchmark for determining the competitive situation on the Danish meat market. Hence, we analyse the market performance of the strategic groups and we describe the competition on the market, in order to identify the optimal market position for the new products.</dc:description>
