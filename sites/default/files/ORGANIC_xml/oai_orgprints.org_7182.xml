  <dc:description>â€“ The introduction of a benchmarking system with Excel spreadsheet tools for organic pig husbandry is part of a large advisory project in Germany which runs between 2004 and 2007 to train advisers with economical tools using them for the improvement of the farm sector and prepare on-going reliable financial and physical data of the sector. 12 consultants with 21 piglet producers and 26 farms with fattening pigs have  worked out the full-cost-analysis for the years 2004/2005. The result of the first year (2004/2005) were published shortly. &#xD;
The results showed low physical performances against conventionally ones, but better than in a study for the year 2002/2003. The labour income is not satisfying. Only the best 25 % of the groups can reach a sufficient income.</dc:description>
