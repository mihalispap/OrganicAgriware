  <dc:description>The growing organic market demands for methods which can describe food quality within the organic system. With the capillary dynamolysis technique patterns are produced on thin-layer chromatographic paper and evaluated as a fingerprint of the sample as a whole. To be applied in routine analysis the method has to be standardised according to international standard norms. After the laboratory process had been documented and a visual pattern evaluation method had been developed and applied for the evaluation of the patterns, the method was standard-ized for selected carrot and wheat samples, which is described here. For standardization several factors of influence were tested and the reproducibility between 3 different laboratories in the EU was investigated. Wheat and carrot samples from different varieties as well as different nitrogen fertilization could be differ-entiated as statistical significant.</dc:description>
