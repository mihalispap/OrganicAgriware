  <dc:description>Farm diversity is usually associated with a mixture of production branches on the farm, and it is often associated with environmetnally "friendliness". In this study focus is on other types of farm diversity, including non-agricultural farm activities and off-farm income. It is explored how frequent these activities are on the organic farms, their economic importance and the respective participation of farmer and spouse. These diversity measures will be related to farm management in the continuation of the study.</dc:description>
