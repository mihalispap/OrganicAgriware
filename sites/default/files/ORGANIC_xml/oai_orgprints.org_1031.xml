  <dc:description>According to the Council Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 seed and vegetative plant material for organic farming shall be organic. Until 31th december 2003, the competent authority in a member state may give a derogation for this if suitable organic seed is not available. The EU Commission reviews the requirements for seed and other propagating material at the latest by 31th december 2002.  &#xD;
&#xD;
This report give an overview of the rules for production of organic seed in the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden). The production of organic seed is described for each country. In januar 2002, organic seed production was discussed at a workshop in Copenhagen as a part of this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
Special problems discussed in this report are; national criterias concidering availability and suitability, possible strategies against seed borne diseases, organic seed on conversion areas, organic seed for propagation, variety testing and trans-national trade of seed. A national database on available organic seed is recommended and it is concluded that there is a need of national criterias for derogation considering availability and suitability of organic seed lots.</dc:description>
