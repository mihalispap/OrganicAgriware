  <dc:description>The Nafferton factorial systems comparison (NFSC) experiments facilitate the investigation of effects of, and interaction between, three production system components - a) rotational position, b) fertility and c) crop protection management - in organic, conventional and low-input crop management systems. This paper presents first results on pesticide and growth regulator residues observed over a period of two years. Residues were only detected for three (Chlormequat, Chlorothalonil and Aldicarb) of the 28 pesticides used in the experiments. As expected, residue levels were affected by the crop protection practices, but significant effects of fertility management practices were also detected. This indicates that the human health risks associated with pesticide residues may increase in low input systems which attempt to reduce the environmental impact of conventional farming systems by switching to organic matter based fertilisation regimes.</dc:description>
