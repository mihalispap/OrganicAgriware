  <dc:description>Blueberries need acid soils for optimal development and production. Swiss soils are prevalently alkaline, and therefore it is necessary to modify the natural conditions. Traditionally this was done by adding peat. In order to preserve fragile environments, such as peat bogs, the use of peat in organic fiels production is forbidden.&#xD;
&#xD;
Project aims&#xD;
- Evaluate sawdust as a substrate for organic blueberry production in three different cultivation systems and with two different acidification products.&#xD;
&#xD;
Results&#xD;
- It is possible top use sawdust as a substrate for blueberry production in regions with alkaline soils; &#xD;
- The traditional system of digging a fosse and filling it with the substrate (cost intensive) can be replaced with a little fosse, done with a plough and filled with substrate (less cost intensive cost; &#xD;
- Acidification with citric acid does not have good results compared to sulphur applications.</dc:description>
