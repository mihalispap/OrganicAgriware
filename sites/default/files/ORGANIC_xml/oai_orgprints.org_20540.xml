  <dc:description>The mulching with chopped grass (GM) and black textile mulch (BTM) were compared to non-mulching control variant (C) with mechanical cultivation in two regions of the Czech Republic. Especially in plots with BTM were first formed ridges and covered by the black polypropylene non-woven textile and then they were planting. The surface mulching of potatoes affected the soil temperature (higher about 0.2 – 1.6 °C than in C) and water potential of the soil (higher only by 8 kPa than in C). GM had a significant effect on the yield of ware potatoes. The final tuber yield was higher by 22.9 % on plots with GM in comparison with C. GM resulted in a significant increase of the number and weight of tuber fraction 56-60 mm and over 60 mm.</dc:description>
