  <dc:description>This contribution deals with occasional consumers attitudes to organic/low input food in relation to quality and safety issues; and presents the results of studies conducted as part of the EU Framework 6 QLIF  research project. The main result shows that a lack of knowledge among con-sumers about the production and processing tech-niques leaves room for a learning process on how to give pragmatic content to the demand from “caring people” and how to allow consumers to learn more about farming and processing.</dc:description>
