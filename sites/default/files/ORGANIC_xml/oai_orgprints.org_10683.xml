  <dc:description>Many different actors have hopes and aspirations for the future of organic agriculture. They have different perspectives on organic agriculture with different understandings of what it is and what makes it move. Each perspective entails a certain understanding of organic agriculture featuring certain concepts and values and a particular logic or rationality. We describe three perspectives based on protest, meaning and market. No perspective is the ‘right’ one and, we claim, different perspectives cannot be merged. We therefore suggest a polyocular approach that may facilitate a broader understanding of organic agriculture by enabling us to handle different perspectives, and which may be helpful in various discourses on the future of organic agriculture and how it may be influenced.</dc:description>
