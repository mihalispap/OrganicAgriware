  <dc:description>The attractiveness of targeted environmental policies on farmlands depends crucially on the&#xD;
opportunity costs of the conservation programs. We use a crop diversity index as an indicator of&#xD;
environmental output to compare the efficiency of conventional and organic crop farms. Technical&#xD;
efficiency scores are estimated by applying data envelopment analysis to a sample of Finnish farms&#xD;
for the period 1994 – 2002. We also estimate shadow values, or the opportunity costs, of producing&#xD;
crop diversity. Our results show that there is variation in the shadow values between farms and the&#xD;
technology adopted. The findings provide a basis for designing cost-effective policy instruments&#xD;
such as auctions for conservation payments.</dc:description>
