  <dc:description>Since the Ottawa charter on the importance of health promotion in settings the school has been&#xD;
named as one of the most important arenas for interventions to promote physical activity and&#xD;
healthy eating. Especially the school food service has been the object of a change agenda that has&#xD;
been named the European school food revolution. This revolution is characterized not only&#xD;
attempts to promote healthy eating but also by attempts to make food supply and consumption&#xD;
more sustainable by integrating organic procurement policies. The current study aims at&#xD;
investigating how these two agendas work together. Do they compete or do they go hand in hand&#xD;
as previous studies suggest? And if this is the case does organic food schemes at school and related&#xD;
curricular activities then induce healthier eating behaviours among children? The research that is&#xD;
part of the iPOPY study was conducted among school food coordinators in public&#xD;
primary/secondary schools (children age from 6 to 15 years old) in Denmark, Germany, Finland and&#xD;
Italy. The study was initiated in Denmark, and subsequently performed in the other three countries&#xD;
through a web‚Äêbased questionnaire. The questionnaire was translated and adapted to fit the&#xD;
different languages and food cultures. The questionnaire researched the attitude, policies and&#xD;
serving practices regarding promoting organic foods and healthy eating habits through school food&#xD;
service and classroom activities. The data suggest that schools with organic supply tend to develop&#xD;
organisational environments that a more supportive for healthy eating than their non organic&#xD;
counterparts. However the results were only significant for Denmark and Italy, In Germany results&#xD;
were significant in some cases where as for Finland there were no differences or results were&#xD;
contradictory. The findings suggest the school food revolution is driven by different agendas but&#xD;
that awareness raising on nutrition and sustainability issues seems to be an important feature of&#xD;
many change processes. Findings also suggest that the two agendas although separated in the&#xD;
scientific literature is much more integrated in the everyday life perspective of school practitioners</dc:description>
