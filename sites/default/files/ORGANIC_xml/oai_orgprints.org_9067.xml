  <dc:title>The Danish case study on coexistence and seed production of forage and vegetable crops</dc:title>

  <dc:subject>Production systems</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>Co-existence is defined as the farmers being able to choose between conventional, organic and genetically modified (GM) crop production, in compliance with the relevant legislation on labelling rules and purity standards.  Genes of cultivated plants spread in time and space through pollen and seed dispersal, and in addition handling during transport and processing may also disperse seeds.&#xD;
The starting point in plant production is the seed. Consequently, suitable measures during cultivation, harvest, transport, storage, and processing are necessary to ensure co-existence in the supply chain of propagated seed.&#xD;
In crops with restricted production area such as hybrid oilseed rape and vegetables, seed production in confinement may serve as an instrument of obtaining GM-free seed or seed with a very low GM-content.</dc:description>
