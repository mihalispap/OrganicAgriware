  <dc:description>The apple variety Braeburn is very popular among the organic apple growers in South Tyrol. Braeburn brings&#xD;
high and regular yields and good prices at the north European fruit and vegetable market. Braeburn is quite&#xD;
susceptible to scab and mildew. To regulate this latter disease the organic orchardists use mainly sulphur&#xD;
products. Braeburn however is sensitive to sulphur treatments. Mainly during summer at high temperatures&#xD;
the leaves of Braeburn treated with sulphur develop a yellowish colour and necrotic spots. A field-trial was&#xD;
carried out for 2 years to investigate which sulphur formulations and application techniques give less phytotoxic&#xD;
problems to leaves and fruits of the apple variety Braeburn. The results show only small differences&#xD;
between the sulphur formulations and mixtures. The overhead irrigation system shows significantly less damaged&#xD;
leaves but there were no significant differences in the percentage of sunburned fruits.</dc:description>
