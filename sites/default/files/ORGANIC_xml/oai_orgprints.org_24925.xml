  <dc:description>A review of research on growth processes in quality food chains in Norway shows that only a few studies have focused on growth in such chains. Studies look at food businesses as the focal unit and discover many challenges for local firms with growth ambitions. The main issues seem to concern distribution and follow-up sales, where communicating qualities of products to customers is a key challenge. Other challenges observed were developing and maintaining qualities of products to gain premium priced products, the financing of growth, developing the business organisation and establishing cooperation and networks for growth.</dc:description>
