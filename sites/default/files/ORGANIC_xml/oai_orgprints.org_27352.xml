  <dc:description>A study with organic broilers with access to a large range area with herbs was performed and the effect of three broiler genotype (JA757, T851, SU51) with different growth rates and different feeding strategies (HP vs LP) on the animals' feed intake, growth and welfare was investigated. The results so far indicate that feed intake from range and animal welfare is dependent on type of allocated feed and growth rate of the broiler genotype. Thus, gait scores and foot and plumage condition showed that the fastest growing broiler genotype had some problems when fed normal broiler feed, whereas this was not the case for the other genotypes. The fastest growing broilers also ate more pelleted broiler feed compared to the slower growing breeds, which in contrast ate more whole wheat. Broilers fed LP feed had a higher intake of feed from range indicated by the crop content.</dc:description>
