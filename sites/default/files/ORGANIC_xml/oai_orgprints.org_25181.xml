  <dc:description>The contribution revisits the results of a case study conducted in 2009, eliciting quality aspects within a mid-scale values based supply chain. Its main objective is to show how organic values can be combined with new forms of relationships in enlarged regional food supply chains beyond direct marketing. Actors along the supply chain employ similar quality argumentations and a similar understanding of fairness and social sustainability. Moreover their perceptions comply to a large extend with the expectations of consumers. Regional embeddedness and spatial proximity is a key element to achieve this synergy.</dc:description>
