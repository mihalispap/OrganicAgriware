  <dc:description>The world is changing;it is always changing. Thatâ€™s one of the fundamental rules of organic farming: adapt to change. We need to adapt to the rain, to the wind, to the dry seasons, to the cultures. But now we have new challenges. Climate change is now here, obesity, diabetes, allergies, stress, are all around us. Economic crisis, new structures blooming, cultures mixing, globalization. Everywhere youth leads adaptation to change. Questions appear: how to, should we, what we need to change, are we the ones.&#xD;
Young people from all around the globe are getting together, discussing, exchanging, trying to reach a common goal, trying to build a path to take. Groups, associations, all kinds of organizations of young people developing organic farms, organic farmers markets, developing/inventing/discovering renewal energies, building sustainable communities.</dc:description>
