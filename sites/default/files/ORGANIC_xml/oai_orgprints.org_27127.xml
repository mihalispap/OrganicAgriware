  <dc:description>Sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of milk production were analysed on organic and conventional dairy farms from cradle to farm gate and resulted in a mean of ca. 1 kg CO2 eq kg ECM-1 independent of the farm system. When calculated according to dry matter intake of the cows, mean percentages of GHG emissions from enteric fermentation on organic or conventional farms were 31 or 42 % from the complete product related emissions from milk production from cradle to farm gate, respectively. When feed quality parameters were considered in calculation, enteric methane production increased considerably with higher fibre contents in feedstuffs. This was especially important at lower milk yields. On the 44 farms that were analysed, minimal potential GHG emissions from enteric fermentation on the herd level were 0.39 (organic farm) and 0.32 kg CO2 eq kg ECM-1 (conventional farm). This is proposed as unavoidable range for milk from intensive conventional and organic dairy production. GHG emissions from replacement animals and from feedstuff production are also part of the dairy systems. These emissions can only partly be reduced by feedstuff man-agement, manure management and technical measures, e.g. slurry cover, biogas production. Efficiency gains in all steps of the process chain by appropriate manage-ment appear to be most important for (reliably) reducing GHG emissions, e.g., by optimal feed quality and its related good milk yields and healthy and long living cows.</dc:description>
