  <dc:description>Several products were tested for their efficacy in control of the apple seed moth (Grapholita lobarzewskii Ragonot). None of them had a good efficacy. With several treatments with Bacillus thuringiensis an efficacy about 50 % could be achieved. An early treatment before egg-laying seem to improve the results. Quassia extract (9 g Quassin/ha/m tree height) gave efficacy about 50-60 % even if treated only once. NeemAzal gave only moderate efficacy (about 40-50 %). Mating disruption method was effective if the populations were not too high when the treatements were started. With high populations there was no sufficient control in the first year of application.</dc:description>
