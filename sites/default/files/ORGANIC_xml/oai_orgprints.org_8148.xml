  <dc:description>The aim of the present work was to assess recurrence rates of the inflammation of the mammary gland in cattle treated either with allopathic, homeopathic or combined medications. The effect of a combination of medications was greater than effects of allopathic drugs alone. In the group of cows, where only allopathic medication was used (control group), the recurrence of inflammations was observed in 70.6 % of the cows during a three month period. Cows, which were given homoeopathic drugs in order to prevent inflammations of the mammary gland (treatment group), had a recurrence rate, which was observed to be 42% during a 3 month period of application.</dc:description>
