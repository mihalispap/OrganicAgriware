  <dc:description>The BNN-Monitor on Sustainability was developed to analyze, communicate and coordinate sustainability performance of processors and wholesalers of organic products. It was developed in a joint process by BNN and its participating members. It is built on about 140 criteria in a three columns model of ecological, social and economic issues. A yearly report shows the achievements, makes them comparable and gives a basis to communicate on company and organic sector level.</dc:description>
