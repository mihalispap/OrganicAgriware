  <dc:description>In recent years, biological fertilizers have received special attention in sustainable agriculture. Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria had significant effects on corn photosynthesis and yield; the highest photosynthesis rate and yield were obtained with dual inoculation with fungus plus bacteria. These outcomes were also affected by cropping systems, but to a lesser extent. Therefore in organic and low input cropping systems, a combination of mycorrhiza and free-living bacteria performed satisfactorily.</dc:description>
