  <dc:subject>Consumer issues</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>The „Sustainable consumption, production and communication“ by the Corvinus University of Budapest were one of the projects that were supported by the Norway Grants. The way products and services are delivered to our doors have become increasingly more complex, and made knowledge about consumer and production habits, trends, development and influence connected to sustainable development important issue that need to be addressed, researched and disseminated. More information about the way societies produce and consume and how we can make findamental changes in the area, are vital to archive global sustainable development.&#xD;
The Corvinus project focus on cooperation in several scientific areas. This is crucial to understand the environmental impact on final consumption, as well as to create concrete proposals to move consumption, production and service habits in Hungary in the direction of sustainability.</dc:description>
