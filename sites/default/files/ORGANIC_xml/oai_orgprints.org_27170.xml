  <dc:description>Crop competition is a key component of an integrated approach to weed management.  Variation in competitive ability and competitive traits have been identified in many other crop species, however little work has been done on oats.  &#xD;
Trials were carried out over four years at one organic site with five husked and three naked oat varieties.  Mid-season Leaf Area Index (LAI) and tillering ability were identified as weed suppressive traits using path analysis.  Differences in weed tolerance were found among varieties.  Trade-offs may exist between competitive traits and yield potential which could be optimised by limiting competitive traits later in the season.&#xD;
Selection of competitive traits with high heritability, whilst minimising yield penalties, could be applied in breeding programmes to develop varieties with greater weed competitive ability.</dc:description>
