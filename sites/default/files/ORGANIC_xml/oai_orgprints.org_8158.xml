  <dc:description>In the DARCOF II BAR-OF project, six variety mixtures are studied in organic as well as conventional growing systems in the period 2002 to 2005. The focus has been on competitive ability of the component varieties in addition to their disease resistance. This study is included in a European Network on sustainable low-input cereal production focusing on varietal characteristics and crop diversity (SUSVAR - COST 860), initiated in 2004. The following is based on papers presented at two SUSVAR workshops.</dc:description>
