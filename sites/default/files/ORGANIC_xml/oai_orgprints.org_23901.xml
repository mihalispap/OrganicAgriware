  <dc:description>In Finland, as well as in many other countries, on-farm research is becoming more and more common. The reasons are many-fold. Agricultural research stations are closed down due to economical constraints and researchers want to have ‘real data’ from the farms. Advisors see on-farm research as a new and efficient tool to show farmers good practices in their production. In addition, for farmers it is an attractive way of testing suitable farming practices in the environment of their own farm.</dc:description>
