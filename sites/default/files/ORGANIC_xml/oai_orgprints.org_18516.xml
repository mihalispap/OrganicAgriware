  <dc:description>The knowledge about Lucerne as part of the grass sward in systems with intensive grazing is limited, therefore some additional registration has been made both in year 2007 when the sward was established and during the period of utilization in 2008 (Table 1). As seen, is the proportion of Lucerne in 4 of the farms both in May and August at a very low level.</dc:description>
