  <dc:description>This is the second report the Biological Farmers of  Australia has commissioned to help industry bench mark the growth and health of its sectors. This report - another significant milestone in the two decade plus history of the rapidly developing Australian certified organic sector - builds the information base for industry to benchmark production and market value against past and current claims and estimates and will enable monitoring of future growth of the certified organic market in Australia and its farming and production base. In an industry characterised by operational diversity, this report allows for performance assessment by sector. The next publication in this series is planned in 2012 (biennial since the inaugural report in 2008) as a means of providing the wider industry with invaluable and realistic market information.</dc:description>
