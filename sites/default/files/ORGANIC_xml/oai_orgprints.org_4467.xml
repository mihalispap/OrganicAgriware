  <dc:subject>Soil quality</dc:subject>
  <dc:description>A field study evaluated the impact of mulching or incorporating two organic materials with differing C:N ratios on selected soil properties and the productivity of organically grown mungbean in a dry season, under rainfed conditions. While the organic matter improved the soil parameters and hence yields, incorporation had a greater beneficial impact on measured parameters, except weed numbers, which were reduced significantly by mulching with straw. Gliricidia leaves, with a lower C:N ratio than rice straw, had the better effect on soil properties and crop growth. The potential for using commonly available organic materials in smallholder tropical cropping systems to enhance productivity in dry seasons is discussed.</dc:description>
