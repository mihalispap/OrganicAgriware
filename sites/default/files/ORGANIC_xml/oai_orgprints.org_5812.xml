  <dc:description>Density and management of landscape elements on organic farms were investigated for 345 organic farms in Denmark in 2001, representing approximately 10% of the total number of organic farms. The density of hedgerows, area habitats and ponds was estimated and related to various aspects of farm character, such as size, type and lifestyle/part time/full time farms, as well as region and biophysical context. A large variation in the densities was found, the highest densities were found on the smallest farms. Farm size was the farm parameter that was closest related to the density of landscape elements as well as landscape structural variables. Farm size was related to the other farm characteristics.</dc:description>
