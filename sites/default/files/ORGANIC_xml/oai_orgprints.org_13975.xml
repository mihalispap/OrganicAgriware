  <dc:description>Conclusions&#xD;
- New forms of collective farmers’ marketing that go beyond traditional cooperative mechanisms can be observed across Europe&#xD;
- These can be understood as responses to changing market, policy and societal contexts:&#xD;
-- Loss of control over supply chains due to dominant position of retailers and concentration in retailing &amp; processing&#xD;
-- Increased production / processing standards&#xD;
-- Growing differentiation of rural areas, evolving urbanrural relations, and changes in EU rural policy frameworks new opportunities&#xD;
-- New markets for distinctive food qualities, services &amp; public goods&#xD;
- Collective organic farmers’ marketing initiatives apply a diversity of strategies ­ sometimes in combination ­ that are crucial to understand their functioning and (potential) impacts</dc:description>
