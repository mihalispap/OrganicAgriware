  <dc:description>Modern society faces decreased biodiversity in nature caused by increased uniformity in agriculture, and health related problems with nutrition caused by industrialisation in food production. Conversion to organic farming increases biodiversity, because of diversification in crops and decreased intensity in control of weed and pests, and increase biochemical diversity within food products because of decreased nitrogen application in field. The author argues that the positive effects of in organic farming can be further improved by improved genetic diversity within the crop. Inter-cropping and variety mixtures are already  used by some farmers, but diversity within the crop can be further improved by development of composite cross populations, composition of new stabilized populations, and reintroduction of historic varieties and populations.</dc:description>
