  <dc:description>While breeding for organic farming it is necessary to identify the most appropriate&#xD;
growing conditions in which to perform the selection process. Soil fertility, crop&#xD;
management, yield level and other factors may vary very much between each organic&#xD;
farm, and between organic farms and research institutions where the selection is usually&#xD;
performed. Since plant breeding requires considerable input of resources and the market&#xD;
for organic varieties is limited, it is essential to find the most appropriate selection&#xD;
conditions that will provide acceptable varieties for organic farms.&#xD;
Spring barley breeding lines selected from two cross combinations (Primus/Idumeja and&#xD;
Anni/Dziugiai) at two distinctive organic and two conventional locations were used in the&#xD;
study. The organic location 1 was situated in a research field of the plant breeding&#xD;
institute (with green manure as fertilizer), the organic location 2 included an organic&#xD;
farmerâ€™s field (with stable manure as fertilizer), the conventional location 1 was located&#xD;
in a barley breeding field (with medium level of mineral fertilizer input) and the&#xD;
conventional location 2 in a seed production field of the institute (with high mineral&#xD;
fertilizer input).&#xD;
Selection of the breeding lines was done under the respective growing conditions starting&#xD;
from F3 generation. Most appropriate lines for growing in organic farming were selected&#xD;
at all 4 environments. Selected breeding lines were evaluated in F5 (n=20-23 per cross&#xD;
combination, without replications) and F6 generations (n=10 per cross combination, 3&#xD;
replications).&#xD;
Correlations between barley traits and the environments and cross combinations will be&#xD;
compared in the presentation.&#xD;
The analysis of the correlation between grain yield and observed plant traits of F5 lines&#xD;
indicated that tendencies between the lines obtained from both cross combinations as well&#xD;
as between the environments were dissimilar in most of the cases. Soil shading&#xD;
(evaluated at early stem elongation stage) correlated positively with grain yield in all&#xD;
cases; the correlation was always significant for lines from the cross Primus/Idumeja, but&#xD;
only at the conventional location 2 for Anni/Dziugiai lines&#xD;
(p&lt;0.05). A significant positive correlation between grain yield and plant development&#xD;
speed at tillering stage as well as between yield and plant height at the beginning of stem&#xD;
elongation was found for Primus/Idumeja lines at both organic&#xD;
locations and at the conventional location 1 (p&lt;0.05). Plant height before harvest did not&#xD;
correlate significantly with yield under organic conditions which is in contradiction with&#xD;
some other studies. There was a tendency for planophyle growth&#xD;
habit to correlate positively with yield under organic and conventional conditions for&#xD;
lines from both cross combinations.&#xD;
The analysis of correlation of the F6 lines will be included in the presentation.&#xD;
This study was performed with financial support of EEA grant EEZ08AP-27and&#xD;
European Social Fund co-financed project&#xD;
