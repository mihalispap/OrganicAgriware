  <dc:description>The presentation was held on the EU IFOAM forum during the BioFach 2010. First results from this explorative research on the status quo of organic certification on mass catering actions were presented. The study was performed during the european iPOPY(innovative Public Organic Procurement for Youth)-research project funded by CORE Organic (Part I) . The results clarify how different the member states work with the grey area of non-regulation of organic certification in mass catering actions. It is displayed that operators as certification bodies and other professionals who are familar with this sector are more or less unsatisfied. On the majority the respondents think of mainly positive impacts if they think about a potential harmonisation process of organic certification in mass catering actions in the EU.</dc:description>
