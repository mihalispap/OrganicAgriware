  <dc:description>A hilly site with variable soils and facing all the problems of modern agriculture was re-designed and converted to organic agriculture in 1992. After 10 years of measurements and observations it was determined that soil compaction, runoff, and erosion were reduced, quality of groundwater and ponds was gradually enhanced, diversity of wildlife was enriched, and the economic situation of the farmer was improved. Besides landscape design, conversion to organic agriculture is regarded as a key instrument towards sustainable land use in this region.</dc:description>
