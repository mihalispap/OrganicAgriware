  <dc:description>Due to the outgoing transitional arrangements for the use of conventional protein sources for monogastric animals in organic livestock farming, alternatives are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of the leaf mass of clover-like legumes in the diet of pigs. Therefore the yields of digestible protein per hectare of the investigated plant samples are compared to that of faba beans, lupines and peas as established organic protein sources. The yields of digestible crude protein per hectare of the clover-like legumes are higher than that of faba beans and peas. Although the faba beans and peas have some higher crude protein digestibility of about 80%, the examined plant samples are due to the higher content of protein in the leaf mass rich in digestible crude protein. The results indicate that the recovery of the leaf mass is a potential protein resource for organic pig farming.</dc:description>
