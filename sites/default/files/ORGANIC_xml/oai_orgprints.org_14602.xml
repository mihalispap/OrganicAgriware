  <dc:description>Based on the encouraging results of the diploma thesis from Sibylle Sp√§th in 2000, a series of experiments in the greenhouse followed in 2001 to test different extracts from medicinal plants against apple scab. The seedlings of the variety 'Golden Delicious' were infected artificially by spraying a suspension of conidia from scab-infected leaves from the orchard. The plant extracts were compared with copper-hydroxid. A few extracts seem to be successful against apple-scab. In the future further experiments in the greenhouse and in the orchard will follow to confirm the promising results and to find more information about side effects like phytotoxity, russeting or thinning.</dc:description>
