  <dc:description>In the TILMAN-ORG project, results from studies using reduced tillage and green manures in organic systems are currently being compiled. The data is being sourced from both published sources and ongoing field trials. In this talk we will summarize what the data is telling us so far, focussing on the benefits that can be realised from these practices, as well as key challenges associated with reduced tillage and green manures on organic farms.</dc:description>
