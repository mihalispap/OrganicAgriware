  <dc:description>In an ongoing study, which focuses on the implementation of animal health plans in organic pig production, the status quo of animal health of sows and piglets in 20 organic farms in Germany was assessed. Standard livestock data showed distinct variations. The on-farm assessment brought up weak-points in hygienic, nutritional and animal health management. Gathered data will be used to develop stock customized optimisation strategies with the aim to achieve superior health standards, including an assembly of cost- benefit relationships.</dc:description>
