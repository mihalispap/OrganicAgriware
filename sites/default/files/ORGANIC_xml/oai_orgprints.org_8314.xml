  <dc:description>In the last decade, a lot of work has been done to develop new measures or to optimise existing seed treatment methods for use in organic farming. In the field of vegetable seed protection, national research projects as well as the EU-funded project “STOVE” (“Seed Treatments for Organic Vegetable Produc-tion”) are currently carried out.&#xD;
Among the physical methods, hot water, humid hot air and electron treatment are being investigated. All three physical treatment methods show clear reduc-ing effects on pathogens of infested vegetable seeds. Degree of effectiveness connected with a good com-patibility depends on the treatment method and on the host-pathogen-system, but also on the cultivar and even on the seed lot.</dc:description>
