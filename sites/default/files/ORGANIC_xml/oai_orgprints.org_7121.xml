  <dc:description>It is defined the possibility of using of natural raw materials for organic agriculture and remediation of soils polluted by heavy metals and radionuclides as well. It is carried out the research on agrochemical properties and assessment of ecological safety of organic raw materials of Belarus (sapropels, peat, forest products) and compositions based on them. It is investigated sorption properties of the materials and compositions and it is estimated efficiency of their application for remediation of soils polluted by radionuclides and heavy metals. It is developed and certificated a range of organomineral compositions for organic farming in semi-arid and arid conditions.</dc:description>
