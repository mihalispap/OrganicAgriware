  <dc:description>Organic production is located mostly in the northern and eastern parts of Tanzania. Production consists mainly of coffee, tea, nuts, spices and various types of vegetables. In addition to the fertile soils and good climatic conditions in this part of the country, urban centres, accessible infrastructure, and transportation possibilities play an important role. For example, the northern region of Kagera, bordering Uganda, is only 200 kilometres from the Ugandan capital Kampala with its international airport Entebbe. The region of Arusha, close to the fertile volcano soils of Kilimanjaro, likewise has an international airport, and in the east at the coast, the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam (which is Arabic for ‘heaven of peace’), offers international air travel as well as harbour freight possibilities</dc:description>
