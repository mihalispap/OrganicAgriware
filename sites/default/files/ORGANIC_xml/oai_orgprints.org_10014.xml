  <dc:description>It is known that pure inulin a fructooligosaccharide extracted from chicory roots can:&#xD;
reduce boar taint (skatole in backfat and blood)reduce parasite infection levels when added to specially composed experimental diets.&#xD;
However, the entire chicory roots may, in comparison to inulin: &#xD;
reduce boar taint more effectively improve the taste of cooked meat from both male and female pigs be more effective against parasites when added to normal diet types &#xD;
Improved stable environment due to: &#xD;
the reduced malodour coming from pig stables and manure may possibly lead to environmental benefits for the farmer and the public?</dc:description>
