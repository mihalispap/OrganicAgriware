  <dc:description>The abundance of entomopathogenic nematodes and soil dwelling stages of plant specific insects was studied in an organic cropping system for two years. In addition was the survival of an inoculated strain of Steinernema feltiae studied. The abundance of naturally occurring entomopathogenic nematodes was in general at a low level throughout the observation period (0-26 % positive samples). Inoculated S. feltiae established well when pea was grown in the same or in the following year whereas the nematodes were less able or unable to establish in the other crops (cabbage, carrots, barley, alfalfa/clover). The successful establishment of nematodes, and the abundance in general, correlated well with the presence of plant specific insects.</dc:description>
