  <dc:description>Common bunt (Tilletia tritici syn. T. caries) is a significant seed borne plant disease in organic agriculture. General measures in ecological crop protection like crop rotation and manuring practice has in practice failed to control this disease, and direct seed treatment therefore seems to be necessary to ensure yield and food quality. Current study indicate that biological control can give successful control without negative effects on seed germination vigour. A combination of biocontrol agents and milk powder improves the effect of the biocontrol. Application of compost to the soil increases the frequency of this disease. The potential role of biocontrol within the principles of ecological disease management is being discussed.</dc:description>
