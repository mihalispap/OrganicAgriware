  <dc:description>40 L. dorsi muscles from the left half carcass of suckling lambs raised under both organic and conventional systems were evaluated by a sixteen-member trained panel, following QDA methodology. After developing a common vocabulary for the evaluation of characteristics, 30 meat descriptors in raw and grilled meat were selected. Additionally,overall appreciation was evaluated by 140 consumers in a home-use test. The results obtained show that the appearance of the organic meat was more fibrous, darker, and with a lower aroma intensity than the conventional counterpart, but with no differences in homogeneity or juiciness. In grilled meat, the organic samples had less subcutaneous fat,less fatness, a less fibrous texture and less aroma intensity, but also less juiciness. Regarding overall appreciation, the consumers gave higher scores to the organically produced samples.</dc:description>
