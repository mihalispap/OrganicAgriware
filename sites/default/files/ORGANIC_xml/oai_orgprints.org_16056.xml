  <dc:description>Fungal entomopathogens are seemingly ubiquitous in soils. An increasing number of surveys around the world have shown that ascomycete fungi from the Hypocreales can be isolated from soils of many habitats. Based on morphological characteristics of the fungi some patterns of distribution have emerged. However, recent developments in molecular characterization of entomopathogenic fungi have revealed significant new insights into the distribution of genetic groups of some taxa, including Beauveria spp, and possible restrictions to certain habitats. I will present and discuss some of these distribution patterns and include new findings which indicate that some fungi are restricted to underground lifestyles while others cycle between below- and aboveground habitats within an agroecosystem.</dc:description>
