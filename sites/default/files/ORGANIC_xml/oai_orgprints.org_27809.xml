  <dc:description>A two-year project from the Leonardo da Vinci - European education fund, entitled „On Farm Education Towards Organic Farmers“, brings together consultants, farmers, NGOs and researchers to gain experience in on-farm research and ways how to share knowledge in organic farming best practice.  &#xD;
Participants of the project will learn about existing or developing networks of organic farming best practice. In these networks farmers, researchers and advisors work together to bring solutions to very specific farming issues in certain environmental conditions which include simple field trials, focus groups, field days and many other forms of knowledge sharing. &#xD;
This project is coordinated by four partners in four European countries: Czech Republic (CTPOA/Bioinstitut), Hungary (ÖMKi), Austria (FiBL) and Luxemburg (IBLA).</dc:description>
