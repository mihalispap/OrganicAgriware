  <dc:description>Research in organic food and farming is a fairly new, but rapidly ex-panding, discipline on the European research scene. One of the problems faced by the authorities seeking to initiate research programmes in organic food and farming is that the present research effort in Europe is caracterised by small research communities, which are often scattered and fragmented both geographically and institutionally. Therefore a gathering of the dispersed expertise to a critical mass in order to increase the competitive quality and relevance of the research as well as the dessemination and use of research is needed.</dc:description>
