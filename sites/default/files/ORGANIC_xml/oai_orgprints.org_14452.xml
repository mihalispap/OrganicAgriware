  <dc:description>The intention of this research project, which was supported within the "Bundesprogramm Ã–kologischer&#xD;
Landbau", was to find alternatives for the control of Venturia inaequalis for the organic fruitgrower.&#xD;
Beside the investigations on reducing the ascospore potential on fallen leaves, experiments&#xD;
were conducted in laboratory, greenhouses and in orchard to test direct control of scab with different&#xD;
plant extracts, concentrations and methods of extraction. Extracts from Inula viscosa, Quillaja&#xD;
saponaria-bark, citrus-species (AGROMIL) and Saponaria officinalis revealed a distinct efficacy&#xD;
against apple scab in greenhouse studies on apple seedlings. ELOT-VIS, CHITOPLANT, COMCAT,&#xD;
MOOSEXTRAKT, SILIOPLANT und FZB 24 did not show sufficient efficacy with the application schedule&#xD;
used for control of scab. Mixtures of Quillaja-saponine and sulphur reduced effectively apple scab&#xD;
incidence. In an experiment concerning rain stability Citrus-extract and Quillaja-saponine showed a&#xD;
lower efficacy against scab after a simulated rain of 5 mm. The screening of different supplements&#xD;
to Citrus-extract as surfactants and adhesives revealed GREEMAX and BIOPLUSS as promising additives.&#xD;
Both combinations showed an efficacy comparable to copperoxychloride corresponding to&#xD;
400 g elementary copper per ha.</dc:description>
