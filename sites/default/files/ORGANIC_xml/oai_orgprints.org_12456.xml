  <dc:description>Two cultivars (Open Pollination OP and hybrid) were evaluated in a rotation with green manure (Crotalaria juncea) and four biol concentrations (0, 20, 40 and 100%) on organic spinach crop. A statistical complete randomized block under factorial design was used. The yield was highly statically significant for the rotation with green manure (24.3 t/ha), biol (25.8 t/ha) and the interaction of rotation x cultivar (25.2 t/ha), where the production of the OP was superior to hybrid, when green manure was used. High yields obtained when green manure in rotation and high biol concentrations were used,  justifies its wide and common use, especially with small farmers, improving the spinach organic production efficiency even when an OP cultivar was used.</dc:description>
