  <dc:description>In an organic dairy herd (250 cows) a homeopathic dry cow treatment should be evaluated while an antibiotic dry cow therapy (DCT) was totally abandoned. A ran-domized placebo-controlled double blind study with a herd specific nosode (D30) was conducted. Either 5 ml of the nosode (VG) or a placebo (KG) was orally administered in weekly intervals four times before drying off, at the day of calving and seven days post partum (p.p.). The efficacy of treatment was measured according to quarter foremilk samples at the days of treatment, six weeks p.p. and at the end of the 2nd and 3rd month of lactation. Data of 129 cows with 512 quarters (VG:n=65/260; KG:n=64/252) was evaluable. New intramammary infections (IMIn) cure rates and cases of clinical mastitis in both treatment groups were nearly identical. In the VG 20% of the quarters came along with IMIn. In the KG IMIn were about 5% higher along the observation period (p&gt;0.05). The cure rates of infected quarters were about 40% in both treatment groups (p&gt;0.05). The complete abdication of antibiotics in DCT did not cause an impairment of udder health. Moreover the number of healthy quarters in-creased and the mean bulk milk somatic cell count decreased slightly during the study. The results of the study show that the use of antibiotics can be highly de-creased though a minimal use is indispensable, especially in herds suffering from udder health problems. Still the most essential prophylactic task is to optimize the housing conditions in the dry period and around calving. The presented dry cow man-agement in conjunction with a selective use of antibiotics can be implemented in veterinary herd health programs on other dairy farms.</dc:description>
