  <dc:description>Central American countries are important producers of organic products. Their export base, however, is heavily dependent on a limited number of products (coffee, cocoa, banana, sugar), which is threatening the sustainability of this export sector. Therefore, there is an urgent need to diversify the export base and develop regional and national markets, which are continuously growing and have an interesting potential. The purpose of this study is to give an overview of the current mood and potential of the European organic and Fairtrade market, as well as Central American products. &#xD;
The study has been developed for the project ECOMERCADOS, which is financed by SECO.</dc:description>
