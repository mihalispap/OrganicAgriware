  <dc:description>The carrot fly Psila rosae is a major pest in organic carrots. Damage strongly depends&#xD;
on local factors and is often found when cropping intensity is high. However, limited&#xD;
field site availability may require growing carrots close to crop sites of preceding&#xD;
years. Here, results of the first two years show carrots may be protected from&#xD;
infestation using trap crops (also carrots) to bind and actively reduce the local P. rosae&#xD;
population. To protect the main carrot field, pair wise arrangements of carrot strips&#xD;
were sown 1) directly at the previous year carrot field and 2) close to the main field to&#xD;
protect the present carrots. During the first generation a mean sum of 36 and 62 flies/&#xD;
trap in 2007 and 2008 respectively were monitored with yellow sticky traps (Rebell&#xD;
orange®) leading to high infestation pressure. Monitoring results show the flies are&#xD;
effectively attracted and bound by strip 1) but still negotiate distances of 130 and 180&#xD;
metres between previous and present carrot fields. Carrot strip 1) was to be removed&#xD;
in time to prevent the second generation of P. rosae to develop. Based on the&#xD;
simulation model SWAT monitoring data and damage assessment was used for timing&#xD;
concerns. Hence, critical issues about removing the trap crops are discussed. In 2008&#xD;
eclector traps were established onto the sites of removed trap crops to further verify&#xD;
the effectiveness of trap crop handling. First results positively support applied&#xD;
techniques. All trials are to be repeated during field season 2009.</dc:description>
