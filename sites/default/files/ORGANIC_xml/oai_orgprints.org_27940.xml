  <dc:description>Depending on the availability of data, organic as well as total data for different products, a number of checks to validate the consistency of data can be carried out. Potential quality checks were described in chapter 2.2, which includes a manual for data quality checking procedures. In the results part of this report, these checks were applied to six products from Organic Data Network partners participating in the projectâ€™s case studies.</dc:description>
