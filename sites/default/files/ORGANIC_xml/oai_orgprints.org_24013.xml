  <dc:description>Barriers in the process of knowledge transfer in terms of animal health have been the topic of a study taking different stakeholder perspectives into account. Using instruments of communication science, the perspectives of farmers, agricultural and veterinarian advisors as well as animal scientists were brought together and discussed. The process revealed the following obstacles in the transfer of knowledge concerning animal health: diverging understanding of animal health, complexity of the processes leading to diseases, unclear responsibilities, and role conflicts. We conclude that the current communication structure is not appropriate to enable a targeting transfer of knowledge on the topic of animal health. Hence, an impulse from “outside” is required to irritate the deadlocked situation and provide leadership and orientation.</dc:description>
