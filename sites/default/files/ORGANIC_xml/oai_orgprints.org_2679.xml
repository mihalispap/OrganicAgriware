  <dc:description>Sustaining Animal Health and Food Safety in Organic Farming (SAFO) is a European Commission funded Concerted Action Project with the objective to contribute to improved food safety and animal health in organic livestock production systems in existing and candidate member countries of the European Union. We aim at doing this through exchange and active communication of research results and conclusions between researchers, policy makers, farmers and the wider stakeholder community, including consumers. Workshops form a central part of these activities, documented by the proceedings. This volume with the contributions to first SAFO Workshop in Florence in September 2003 is the first in a series of five proceedings published during the lifetime of the project (2003-2006). &#xD;
&#xD;
The Workshop in Florence on "Socio-Economic Aspects of Animal Health and Food Safety in Organic Farming Systems" focused on financial and economic aspects of organic livestock production at the farm level and in the whole organic food chain. The impact of attitudes of various stakeholders on the development of organic livestock production was also covered. The Workshop was attended by 70 delegates from 22 countries, representing a wide variety of expertise and aspects of organic farming from certification activities, marketing economics and social science to animal health and welfare.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was apparent, from the papers, posters and working group conclusions, that organic livestock producers work within a society and are governed by if not the same – at least very similar - economic constraints as conventional farmers. In addition, they have voluntarily taken onboard the organic rules and values. It is also clear that the interface of the organic values, and those of society and food production at large, can impose complex constraints on production at farm level. For instance, while animal health appears to be an important concept to the consumers in deciding what to buy, there appears to be a discrepancy between the welfare expectations of consumers and the production realities. One of the key issues raised by the workshop was the need to educate the consumer and to focus on the process rather than the product.&#xD;
