  <dc:description>This chapter includes information on the development of the free range and the organic egg production and their market shares in different countries. Consumer behaviour is investigated particularly in relation to the price and availability of non-cage eggs. Regulations on the production of free range and organic eggs and their present and future impact are examined. Nutrient supply, animal welfare, productivity, safety and environmental impact of the types of egg production are covered with a focus on the effects of using different forage materials. Egg quality parameters of egg shell, sensory properties, yolk colour and carotenoid content, egg protein, and egg products are also discussed.</dc:description>
