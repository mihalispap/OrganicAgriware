  <dc:description>This study aimed to study varieties of cabbage, carrots, parsnips, potatoes and swedes under organic conditions and to determine significant factors in the organic production systems that affect variety performance. Additional investigations were carried out with potatoes to study the effects of blight and potato cyst nematode. All trials were conducted on UKROFS registered sites and to appropriate organic husbandry standards. Measurements and assessments followed guidelines used for conventional trials, with quality criteria being based upon the requirements of the retail trade. Any assessment of colour and shape would be in line with established charts and descriptions. Results of the study will provide advice and recommendations to organic growers for variety selection and will identify whether dedicated organic trials are necessary for valid variety comparison.</dc:description>
