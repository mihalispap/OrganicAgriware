  <dc:description>In the recent years there has been a growing concern and debate about ethical values linked to organic foods production and consumption. The growing interest in organic and ethical production and trade has been both consumer driven and trade driven (Browne et al., 2000). Although the debates around the ethics of organic food have typically been framed around a divide between production and consumption (Clarke et al., 2008). Therefore, the present research focus on perceptions and motives of ethical consumer. Itâ€™s aimed initially at exploring the knowledge and awareness of apulian consumers about the link between ethical values and organic production and consumption.</dc:description>
