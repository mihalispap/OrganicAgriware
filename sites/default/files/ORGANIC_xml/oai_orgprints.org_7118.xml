  <dc:description>The organic Charolais suckler farmers of the French Massif Central sell most of their animals on the conventional market. The high cost of the inputs, and in particular the concentrates, is an incentive for these suckler farmers to seek a high degree of food self-sufficiency on their farms. This self-sufficiency is reached through good management of grass and especially through cereal crops for animal feeding. The strong limitation of the inputs does not affect the numerical productivity or the health of the herd, but it entails lower meat productivity per animal and per hectare. However, the operational cost savings make it possible to maintain income per hectare at the same level as that of conventional farms.</dc:description>
