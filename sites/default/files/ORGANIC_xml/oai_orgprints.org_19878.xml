  <dc:description>The total organic market is valued at more than €100 million. The fresh and chilled category accounts for the majority of this (€77.3m), followed by ambient (€22.6) with&#xD;
a very small amount accounted for by the frozen category(€0.7m). Whilst the sector has grown by 82% in the last 2 years (Bord Bia, 2008), there are signs of a slow down&#xD;
in growth. This paper looks at what is going well from a marketing perspective,identifies some areas requiring attention and suggests a change in positioning to&#xD;
maintain current levels of growth.</dc:description>
