  <dc:description>AEGILOPS Network Ecology and Biodiversity in Agriculture was established in 2004. Our purpose is to conserve heritage varieties and traditional agricultural knowledge and to restore landrace varieties into contemporary agricultural practice in ways that benefit the traditional farmers. The goals of AEGILOPS are: &#xD;
a. to develop plant varieties adapted to local organic production which utilize the benefits of locally adapted genetic resources for ecological agriculture, and&#xD;
b. to strengthen the role of the farmers  in the conservation of genetic resources  as well as to protect their rights in taking part in the management and benefits of agrobiodiversity.</dc:description>
